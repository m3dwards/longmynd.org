Wednesday is due to remain heavily inverted pretty much all day with very light and variable winds.  Maybe Wrekin late on, on either side.  At present the rest of the week doesn't look much better.

\-------------------------------------------

Tuesday is due to be pretty well east so Corndon, but it may be a bit windy for PG's, however it's often launchable when other sites such as Malvern and Pandy are blown out, because the wind runs around the hill, but that increases risks, hence why it's not a low airtimers place.  Don't go this morning, it is not due to get any windier in the afternoon and the inversion won't lift enough until late on - evening will likely be best.

\---------------------------------------

Monday has Corndon with light/moderate winds, possibly soarable at times, starting off SE approximately which might be awkward for the south side.  wrekin mioght be better, but the wind is due to go more east as the day progresses so that will benefit Corndon.  Also it will be inverted low down until early afternoon anyway.  Expect significant turbulence from the punchy thermals until late afternoon.

Tuesday maybe a more suited Corndon soaring day with stronger winds and more east. 

Wednesday forecasts vary a lot in conditions, wind direction and speed.  Some have it a more thermic day than Monday but other much less so.

Monday has Corndon with light/moderate winds, possibly soarable at times, starting off SE approximately which might be awkward for the south side.  wrekin mioght be better, but the wind is due to go more east as the day progresses so that will benefit Corndon.  Also it will be inverted low down until early afternoon anyway.  Expect significant turbulence from the punchy thermals until late afternoon.

Tuesday maybe a more suited Corndon soaring day with stronger winds and more east. 

Wednesday forecasts vary a lot in conditions, wind direction and speed.  Some have it a more thermic day than Monday but other much less so.

Tuesday looks like the best chance until the weekend due to wind.  It's still likely to be top end or beyond for PG's today though.  W to WSW wind direction so Mynd might be on.  Reminder about the Notam which in reality limits our western most sites for anyone thinking of going XC - Clatter isn't in the area but wind direction not forecast to be suitable there (though it's ideal just now)   Likely to be very thermic after this front has passed through.

\----------------

Blown out Monday,  Tuesday looks on for the Long Mynd, but please bear in mind it's inside a Military fast jet exercise notam area.  The Notam will preclude any XC flights downwind of Llandinam, Shepherds Tump or Camlo, for safety sake at least.

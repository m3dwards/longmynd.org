Saturday looking good for the Mynd. Probably clagged in during the morning but forecast to clear and be soarable with forecasts varying between WNW to WSW.  Next week looks unflyable so make the most of the best forecast for a while

\--------------------------------------

Today now looks not so good- Wrekin right on the edge of the poor weather to the west so could well be clagged in or drizzly rain.  Saturday looking good though.

\-----------------------------------------

Thursday could be flyable and soarable at the Wrekin SE side looking at current forecast, due for wind to reduce during he afternoon though.  Will need to check again in the morning.  Even if not soarable,  should be ok for launching at least as wehaven't had much chance recently.

\-----------------------------------------------------

Maybe the weekend looks flyable, nothing before

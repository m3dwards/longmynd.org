## **"BBC Weather Monday 14 August to – Sunday 20 August**

### **A drier period next week**

Monday will have further showers scattered around, some heavy with a chance of thunderstorms. Some more persistent rain is possible as well as low pressure lingers near Scotland and a shallow low pressure system scoots past southern England.

A weak high pressure ridge should give drier and warmer conditions from Tuesday to Friday, with just a few isolated showers and temperatures lifting above the August average. A couple of very warm days might be possible, but it won't last.

Shower activity could increase in northern areas by Friday before rain returns to much of the UK at the weekend. The south-east should see the least rain."

**LOCAL FLYING FORECAST**

**Tuesday**. Currently looking like a good soaring day at this point with a RASP 2/3 Star Rating, light westerly winds and a cumulus cloudbase between 3-4000ft, looks like a potential XC or at least a Mynd ridge day. 

**Wednesday**. As the ridge builds further winds veer more N and are light but the Star Rating looks otherwise good again with a good Cu cloudbase. Possibly a Corndon day with XC potential to the SW. 

**Thursday**. Winds continue to veer now to ESE but things are still promising with good XC conditions including a high cloudbase downwind to the west of us, maybe a Corndon or Wrekin day but this far out confidence is always lower, winds may be too strong but fingers crossed.

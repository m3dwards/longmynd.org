Wednesday when looked at ground level winds appears to be potentially flyable at the Mynd, but lapse charts indicate a pretty strong wind at 2000ft at 30mph with strong gusts plus and a lot of low layer cloud so not very inspiring at all.  Yesterday I saw there was flying going on at Llangollen and down in south Wales - anyone did anything on our hills?

\---------------------------------------------------- 

Urgent update.  Tuesday afternoon the winds are due to drop and it should be flyable at Corndon or Red Hopton - winds N to NNE.  Cloudbase good and clear of hills.

\--------------------------------------------------

Mostly windy and low cloud this week.  There is a chance wind speeds ok on Wednesday for the Mynd, but probably very low cloud,  not sure yet whether it will be sufficiently above the hill to make it suitable.

Maybe Sunday - at least it's far enough away to be different.

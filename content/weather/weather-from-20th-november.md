Urgent update.  Tuesday afternoon the winds are due to drop and it should be flyable at Corndon or Red Hopton - winds N to NNE.  Cloudbase good and clear of hills.

\--------------------------------------------------

Mostly windy and low cloud this week.  There is a chance wind speeds ok on Wednesday for the Mynd, but probably very low cloud,  not sure yet whether it will be sufficiently above the hill to make it suitable.

Maybe Sunday - at least it's far enough away to be different.

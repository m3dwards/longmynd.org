Sunday not ideal as expected to be NW direction, fairly windy but Corndon might sort of work a bit.  Dry

Monday lighter and North-ish backing NNW,  starting off Corndon unless goes west of North then Lawley I think as it does take a decent amount of N and you can launch at differing heights depending on the windspeed.  I think Red Hopton and Long Mountain wind might be a bit too light.

Tuesday looks Mynd-able.

No further updates from me as away for a few days.

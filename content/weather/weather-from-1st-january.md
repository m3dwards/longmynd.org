Thursday starts off on the high wind side but rapidly backs to the South and drops off really light, so there may be a slot to fly but could be quite limited.  Depending on exactly when you're there, but could be Mynd, Clatter, Shepherds Tump or Camlo.  Friday I think is looking a bit better than before with cloud above the hills and WNW veering NW and generally a more even wind speed than Thursday,  Weekend still looking possible.

\----------------------------------------------------

Thursday actually looks flyable at present on our SW sites, however some forecasts indicate it may have too much west in it over there but at the Mynd more SW so that won't work either.  If that's the case Shepherds Tump may be a better bet than Clatter as that does not work well if off to WSW or W.

Friday is still quite iffy - Westerly and not strong, but could be misty with a low inversion and maybe clagged in if it does not warm up during the day.  Weekend could be on too as the wind changes direction to the North at some point.

\------------------------------------------------------- 

If you are quick there's a chance this morning at the Mynd before the rain comes in and after the wind drops a little.  End of the week offers some hope (with luck).

Next week look to be more likely dry and going broadly easterly, at least by some forecasts.

Friday for Hang Gliding - possibly a bit far off at the Long Mynd though, forecasts show the wind direction varying between WSW and SW.  At present forecast to be too much for PG launching and soaring.  Weekend blown out.

\-----------------------------

Pretty awful really the whole week, but there is just a chance Tuesday evening for some light wind southerly flying - maybe not ridge soaring.  Wrekin or Corndon as long as any big clouds have gone.

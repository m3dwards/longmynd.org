Changed a bit for Today (Wed) with the wind around here being more WSW as the day goes on, so Mynd could well  b soarable by lunchtime.  If not by teatime the forecasts indicate it will be.  Not exactly on the hill, but sufficient to soar I think.  Clatter still looks ok earlier in the day but once it goes WSW tends not to work at all well.

\-------------------------------

Wednesday looks like a good Clatter day but could be top end for some PG's to launch later on.  Shepherds Tump may also work, but if windy launching PG's can be difficult due to the sharp lip on top and rotor across the launch area.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday at present looks nicely soarable,  might be too south for the Long Mynd, see how forecasts progress before then.  Weekend looking promising too.

Wednesday looks like a good Clatter day but could be top end for some PG's to launch later on.  Shepherds Tump may also work, but if windy launching PG's can be difficult due to the sharp lip on top and rotor across the launch area.

Wednesday at present looks nicely soarable,  might be too south for the Long Mynd, see how forecasts progress before then.  Weekend looking promising too.

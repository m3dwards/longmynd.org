Friday, now has rather stronger winds than ideal for many.  Direction between W and WSW, maybe at times bordering on SW.  Probably top end or beyond for PG's on the Mynd but ideal for HG.  An option I think for PG's may be Camlo as it has a shallow slope and you can launch much lower down, though there is the issue of the forest behind so need to be fully aware of the risk of being blown back if it was too strong for you, or a poor launch and not getting forward.  Other than that it is a great site.  Very thermic and turbulent day.

\---------------------------

Changed a bit for Today (Wed) with the wind around here being more WSW as the day goes on, so Mynd could well  b soarable by lunchtime.  If not by teatime the forecasts indicate it will be.  Not exactly on the hill, but sufficient to soar I think.  Clatter still looks ok earlier in the day but once it goes WSW tends not to work at all well.

\-------------------------------

Wednesday looks like a good Clatter day but could be top end for some PG's to launch later on.  Shepherds Tump may also work, but if windy launching PG's can be difficult due to the sharp lip on top and rotor across the launch area.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday at present looks nicely soarable,  might be too south for the Long Mynd, see how forecasts progress before then.  Weekend looking promising too.

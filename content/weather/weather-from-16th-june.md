Monday now appears by many forecasts to be going almost SW today so the Mynd might not be the greatest place to be for ridge soaring.  Having said that, it does seem to be more likely W late on in the evening, which will be the nicest time to soar as long as the wind speed stays high enough.

Tuesday at present blown out.

\-----------------

Mon/Tue/Wed see mostly W to WSW winds - nicely ridge soarable on Monday at the Long Mynd, possibly too windy for PG's on Tuesday and maybe too light on Wednesday.  Bear in mind that it is due to be very thermic and gusty on those days, so late afternoons or evening may be best for pure pleasant ridge soaring.

After that forecasts vary, maybe howling Southerly on Thursday and then going back west again - but we'll wait and see nearer the time.

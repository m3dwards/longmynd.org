Current forecasts have it too windy for most PG flying for the next week or so, best chance if at all might be today Friday or Saturday before Cu-Nims are forecast to develop in the afternoon.  Corndon much safer than Wrekin due to being blown back risk on the Spine back.

\------------------------------------------------------

Going on yesterdays weather it may not be soarable at Wrekin or Corndon on Thursday.  The lower winds may veer East enough for Corndon to work especially late on.  Don't even bother until late on anywhere though.  Friday looks better for soaring, SE direction.

Saturday might be blown out

\----------------

Wednesday I think has improved in the forecast overnight for the Mynd.  Mostly Westerly, thermic and increasing wind strength in the afternoon.  It does appear as if the sea breeze will penetrate as far as the Mynd today which is unusual, so there may be a change in the airmass sometime in the late afternoon.

\-------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday looks to be a HG day only, probably at the Mynd as it is not due to be as SW as Monday turned out to be.  There is an occluded front coming in from the NW, but not expected to really get to our area until late on, it's possible that it might bring some top cover late on and bring the wind more WNW.

Forecasts for Wednesday have improved with the wind light and very thermic turbulent during the day and mostly on at the Long Mynd  and possibly ridge soarable - best by the look of things in the late afternoon when winds are due to get to nice soarable speeds.

Thursday Corndon possibly.

\-----------------------------

Monday now appears by many forecasts to be going almost SW today so the Mynd might not be the greatest place to be for ridge soaring.  Having said that, it does seem to be more likely W late on in the evening, which will be the nicest time to soar as long as the wind speed stays high enough.

Tuesday at present blown out.

\-----------------

Mon/Tue/Wed see mostly W to WSW winds - nicely ridge soarable on Monday at the Long Mynd, possibly too windy for PG's on Tuesday and maybe too light on Wednesday.  Bear in mind that it is due to be very thermic and gusty on those days, so late afternoons or evening may be best for pure pleasant ridge soaring.

After that forecasts vary, maybe howling Southerly on Thursday and then going back west again - but we'll wait and see nearer the time.

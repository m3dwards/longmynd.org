Today (Thursday), still looking nice but cold so the Long Mynd may be difficult to drive to due to the Ice on the wet roads up.  However, the Mynd may not be the right place anyway, as forecasts vary between N and NW but not very strong.  I think Lawley stands the best chance of accommodating variation in wind direction and speed with launches from multiple heights.  Alternatives, Wrekin, Clunbury, Caer Caradoc.

Thursday and Friday look nice and dry, just as most people have to go back to work.  Winds NNW backing W and might be a bit light for ridge soaring or could be just right.

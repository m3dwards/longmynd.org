Tuesday stayed clagged in on top of the hills or at least the Wrekin and Lawley were.  Wednesday looking much more promising now.  SW winds increasing during the day.  Might be a bit top end launching Wrekin, but Corndon will be easier but not great direction to soar it.

\----------------------------------------------------

Tuesday holds a chance in the afternoon after any rain has cleared with moderate northerly winds, possibly NW at lower levels.  Forecasts have improved a bit overnight and the low cloud/fog risk seems to have reduced. Depending on exactly the direction and wind strength there are lots of options, Corndon, Red Hopton, Wrekin, Lawley, Long Mountain, Llangollen.

Friday looks nice but rather windy, maybe ok for HG's but top end at least for PG's, direction close to North

Saturday looks much better for soaring and thermalling, with more reasonable winds varying around N to NNE, so Corndon looks on.

Sunday has a bit more of a NNW - N direction so Lawley, Clunbury or Wrekin look ok.  If on the windy side, then Long Mountain a safer bet.

\-----------------------------------------------

Rather wet until next weekend, and a bit windy for PG's.  Maybe ok for HG's but will have to time things right to avoid the forecast rain each day, but the positive is that it could be suitable for HG sites, Long Mynd or Clatter.

Monday looks like a receding chance of cunims with the growth not that massive, wind direction more WSW, ok for HG's but top end for PG, better air more into North Wales.

Rather wet until next weekend, and a bit windy for PG's.  Maybe ok for HG's but will have to time things right to avoid the forecast rain each day, but the positive is that it could be suitable for HG sites, Long Mynd or Clatter.

Monday looks like a receding chance of cunims with the growth not that massive, wind direction more WSW, ok for HG's but top end for PG, better air more into North Wales.

Forecasts for Saturday are varying wildly and frequently between West all day, East, light, just nice speed, or rapidly varying during the day.  However so far all forecasts say dry and mostly sunny.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today might be ok at the Long Mynd for Hang Gliders, borderline too windy as the upper winds are strong and the chance of towering Cu is quite high despite the time of the year.

It's a long way ahead, but forecasts suggest a brief interlude in the windy and wet weather on Saturday.

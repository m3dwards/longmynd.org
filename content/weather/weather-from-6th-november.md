Friday has possibly flyable winds, however the upper winds are pretty strong.  Cloudbase maybe 2500ft so should be nice and clear.  Safest bet I think will be Long Mountain for both launchable and soarable speeds, it's west at present but due to be NNW around lunchtime then back a bit to NW.  

Saturday too light to soar on most forecasts but nice and sunny.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

Forecasts for Saturday are varying wildly and frequently between West all day, East, light, just nice speed, or rapidly varying during the day.  However so far all forecasts say dry and mostly sunny.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today might be ok at the Long Mynd for Hang Gliders, borderline too windy as the upper winds are strong and the chance of towering Cu is quite high despite the time of the year.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a long way ahead, but forecasts suggest a brief interlude in the windy and wet weather on Saturday.

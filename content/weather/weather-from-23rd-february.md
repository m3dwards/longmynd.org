Saturday looking promising to soar the Long Mynd - might be a bit off to the south, but air looks a lot better than for many weeks/months.

\---------------------------------------

Windy but at least Rasp suggests there is a very slight chance Friday/Saturday of it being low enough for HG or maybe PG's.  Probably SW direction.

Forecasts vary a lot about the weekend, between nicely soarable with SW winds, to light W or SE or variable and a bit of rain on Saturday morning.  It's going to be one of those times when you just have to see what it's actually like and use the weather stations to make a judgement.

\-------------------------

Missed saying anything about yesterday - did anyone fly around here?

Tuesday is forecast to get sunny this afternoon and flyable at the Mynd or Camlo.

Wednesday windier and SW with an even lower cloudbase, but still might be on at Clatter.

Next week looks promising most days

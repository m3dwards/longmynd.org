Tuesday is promising.  much lighter winds in Wales and maybe a bit high at the Wrekin. Wind direction due to be somewhere between NNW and NNE.  Nice air but expected to be some high level cloud liiting thermals, but for ridge soaring lots of choices but hard to say which as it so depends on wind speed and to a less extent direction.  Wrekin if not too strong, otherwise Corndon, Lawley, Red Hopton, Little London all possible options.

Then go back to bed for another week as raining again - what Rain again?

In spite of the cloud at present, it is due to brighten up shortly and be hang gliding weather at the Long Mynd with base at least 1000ft ATO.  Probably too much wind for PG's though?

\----------------------

Wednesday afternoon for Hang Gliders on the Mynd looks quite promising, windy but decent air if the showers have died away.

Does not look flyable anytime soon.

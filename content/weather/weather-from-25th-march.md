Tuesday looks ok at Corndon in the morning, but there's a bank of rain due in the afternoon and the wind will veer SE and cloud thicken beforehand.  Forecasts vary a bit but probably too much east in it for Wrekin though it is a little further away from the rain which is coming up from Cotswolds sort of direction heading into mid-Wales.

After that, all you can do is hope there's a dry, low wind patch over Easter.

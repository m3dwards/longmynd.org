Saturday looks very good, but might be too radical for pilots at times, as there is due to be towering Cu to nearly 30000ft.  Wind direction due to be SSW backing S or SSE during the day and windier into Wales, but ok speeds a bit further east.  Options - Camlo, just possibly Shepherds Tump - probably too much south in it for Clatter.  Further east, south side of Corndon but not great for soaring really.  Wrekin especially later in the day as it backs.  Cloudbase, except where there are monster could rising to 3400ft plus.

Sunday more SE and windier, but might be ok at Corndon or Wrekin especially earlier in the day

\------------------------------------

Tuesday looks ok at Corndon in the morning, but there's a bank of rain due in the afternoon and the wind will veer SE and cloud thicken beforehand.  Forecasts vary a bit but probably too much east in it for Wrekin though it is a little further away from the rain which is coming up from Cotswolds sort of direction heading into mid-Wales.

After that, all you can do is hope there's a dry, low wind patch over Easter.

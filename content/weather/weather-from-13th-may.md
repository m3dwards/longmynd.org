Thursday has more light to moderate winds and direction at Corndon anywhere between N and E.  thermic with a base heading to 4000ft.  Some fairly large towering clouds are possible but nothing too massive.  Possibly sun reduced by Mid level clouds at times.  So, depending on exactly what wind direction there is and the strength, Corndon could give some nice soaring or purely a wait and launch into a thermal for the most experienced pilots.  with that site, if the wind is NE, statistically it's only the first couple of pilots to launch on a cycle that get up, anyone else ends up missing it.

Friday, might be ok, forecasts vary massively on where the low is and whether it's wet or not, but probably southerly winds.  Weekend not sure about at all.

\---------------------------------------

Wednesday could be ok on Cordon ESE direction but windy, but Corndon can often be suitable even with a good wind as it's not a spineback like the Malverns for instance.

Thursday looks basically dry with light/moderate winds.  Maybe not ideal direction though in our area as NE, so we only have the corner of Corndon which is in no way a suitable ridge soaring location.  But for the experienced thermalling XC pilots can be a frustrating but sometimes very successful launch point.

Saturday might be ok, but again NE direction

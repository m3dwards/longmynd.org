Thursday looks basically dry with light/moderate winds.  Maybe not ideal direction though in our area as NE, so we only have the corner of Corndon which is in no way a suitable ridge soaring location.  But for the experienced thermalling XC pilots can be a frustrating but sometimes very successful launch point.

Saturday might be ok, but again NE direction

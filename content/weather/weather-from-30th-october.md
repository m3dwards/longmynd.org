We are now well into the season of desperation - with so few opportunities to fly safely or pleasantly.  

Monday just possibly for Hang Gliders at Clatter, but a good chance of towering cu spoiling things.

Tuesday might be on at the Mynd for HG and PG, though forecasts vary a lot in direction, but again a good chance of rain at times.

After Tuesday, that could well be the only chance until next week.

Today (Thursday) still looking wrong direction, though it may come just about north enough for Corndon to be ridge soarable on N face later on, right wind speed though.

\----------------------------------------------------

Tuesday now looks blown out, Wednesday even worse and Thursday wrong direction NE.  Friday looks good with light/moderate NW winds.   

\-----------------------

Windy to start the week, just maybe Corndon will be East enough and low enough speeds on Tuesday, but only late in the day once inversions have lifted.  Thursday onwards looking better, but then goes light winds, maybe too light to ridge soar anywhere, but very thermic over the weekend.

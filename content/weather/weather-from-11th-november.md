Friday was Mynd flyable for quite a few on Friday but did get pretty top end for PG's despite all the forecasts indicating it was not going to be windy, no HG's there which was a great shame for them.

Sunday might be ok for HG as west and a good breeze, but too much for PG's.  Rain could spoil play but forecasts vary on that.

\--------------------------------------------------

Mynd is clear of fog and a reasonable wind, so looking positive for today.

\----------------------------------------------------

Don't bank on it, but Long Mynd could possibly be scratchy soarable on Friday afternoon.  Weekend now looks generally wet and blown out for PG's.

\------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday looks like being a difficult wind direction,  somewhere between NNE and NE, probably too far off to the east for Red Hopton and less than ideal for Corndon which is the only option really.  Dry and the actual inversion is at a reasonable height so might be ok to ridge soar.  Wednesday badly inverted so not great and could be foggy.

\----------------------------

At present Monday looks the best day of the week, with the cold front having passed through the air is due to be clear of all of the last weeks yuk.  Wind direction seems to be hovering between NNW and N and should be of a soarable speed.  A weak Inversion starts from 1500 - 2000ft ASL so not likely to be thermic to any great extent despite the forecst sunshine.  Options - Corndon if it's totally N, otherwise try Wrekin,  Lawley or Clunbury.  If not too strong Caer Caradoc as that has a slightly more NNW face than the Lawley and you can launch part way up the spine.  Other options may be Red Hopton if it's quite windy, if less so then LLangollen or Long Mountain.

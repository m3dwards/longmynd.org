At present Monday looks the best day of the week, with the cold front having passed through the air is due to be clear of all of the last weeks yuk.  Wind direction seems to be hovering between NNW and N and should be of a soarable speed.  A weak Inversion starts from 1500 - 2000ft ASL so not likely to be thermic to any great extent despite the forecst sunshine.  Options - Corndon if it's totally N, otherwise try Wrekin,  Lawley or Clunbury.  If not too strong Caer Caradoc as that has a slightly more NNW face than the Lawley and you can launch part way up the spine.  Other options may be Red Hopton if it's quite windy, if less so then LLangollen or Long Mountain.

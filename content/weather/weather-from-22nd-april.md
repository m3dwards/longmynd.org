Well this week looks better from Tuesday onwards, though may be a bit windy.  Cool, thermic turbulent airmass from the North, makes a change from howling damp south west gales all the time.

Tuesday looks to be N to NNE so the north side of Corndon looks on - As long as it is pretty well North or just east of it then that side of the hill provides good soaring with easy access to the bottom landing field adjacent to the main track - much safer for bottom landing than the rocky east side.  One thing to note is that because the hill is a bit of a lump in the middle of the lower ground, the wind tends to venturi around it - that creeates a situation where the hill is often perfectly soarable even though windy lower down, but also increases the risk of being blown around either side side of the hill - serious accidents have resulted so be very aware not to extend ridge soaring beats too far from in line with wind direction.  Please also note the farmers request to walk up the steep NW footpath to keep away from sheep on main pasture.

Wednesday may be similar.  

Thursday might be westerly for Mynd  and good or it might be easterly and rainy - forecasts do not even remotely agree yet!

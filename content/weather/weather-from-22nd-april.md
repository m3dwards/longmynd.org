Friday looks a nice soaring day, cloudy but thermic up to 5000ft late afternoon on Corndon - wind direction ENE - NE but should be about the right speed and direction for ridge soaring as long as not too far NE.

Weekend predominantly wet, but Sunday has a narrow band of rain with northerly winds, so there is some chance somewhere might be flyable if it's dry there.

\-------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, today the forecasts still vary between too light to soar and top end for PG's so I'm not sure.  Wind direction between N and NE, so Corndon looks a possibility as long as mostly North.  The weather and air improves this afternoon.

Wednesday, either the same or slightly less wind and from a NNW to N direction and drier air than today,  So more possibilities as some of our NW facing sites do ridge soar reasonably ok when well off to the North, but don't work when it's too West due to hill profiles.

\-----------------------------

Well this week looks better from Tuesday onwards, though may be a bit windy.  Cool, thermic turbulent airmass from the North, makes a change from howling damp south west gales all the time.

Tuesday looks to be N to NNE so the north side of Corndon looks on - As long as it is pretty well North or just east of it then that side of the hill provides good soaring with easy access to the bottom landing field adjacent to the main track - much safer for bottom landing than the rocky east side.  One thing to note is that because the hill is a bit of a lump in the middle of the lower ground, the wind tends to venturi around it - that creeates a situation where the hill is often perfectly soarable even though windy lower down, but also increases the risk of being blown around either side side of the hill - serious accidents have resulted so be very aware not to extend ridge soaring beats too far from in line with wind direction.  Please also note the farmers request to walk up the steep NW footpath to keep away from sheep on main pasture.

Wednesday may be similar.  

Thursday might be westerly for Mynd  and good or it might be easterly and rainy - forecasts do not even remotely agree yet!

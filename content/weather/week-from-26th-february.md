Sunday has the wind anywhere between South and WSW, but most likely to be SW veering during the day to some extent.  Light and probably not generally ridge soarable, but thermic once the air clears.  Options, Mynd just maybe for the lazy ones not willing to walk, or Clatter if it's actually SW, Shepherds Tump with more wind direction choice on that hill.

\------------------------------------------------------

Yesterday, Saturday looked dry and ok here, but today it's now wet all day, however sunday looks good speed, thermic with decent cloudbase.  Based on the rapidity of the forecasts changing,  I wouldn't camp out ready for a great day.

\-----------------------------

Thursday was ok for some on the Mynd though windy at times but completely dry all day including the grass on launch.

Despite the fact that it's Friday, the forecasts do not agree on the weekend at all, not even remotely agree.  Either Saturday or Sunday or both might be flyable, or even neither.

\-------------------------------------------------

Today (Thursday) looks flyable at the Mynd as the front moves east.  Might be a bit strong for PG, but the air looks ok, though a lot of mid-high cloud on some forecasts.  Backing WSW so not all perfect direction but I think a reasonable chance of it being ok.

\-----------------------------------------

Tuesday/Wednesday was looking ok, but that's all changed, so no good now.  The weekend might be on if the wind is northerly as currently forecast.

Today (Thursday) looks flyable at the Mynd as the front moves east.  Might be a bit strong for PG, but the air looks ok, though a lot of mid-high cloud on some forecasts.  Backing WSW so not all perfect direction but I think a reasonable chance of it being ok.

\-----------------------------------------

Tuesday/Wednesday was looking ok, but that's all changed, so no good now.  The weekend might be on if the wind is northerly as currently forecast.

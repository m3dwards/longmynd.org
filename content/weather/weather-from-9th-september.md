Saturday has moderate to fresh SW winds and not a great thermic day., but if the wind isn't too much then good ridge soaring at Clatter.  Sunday is similar but with a fairly reasonable chance of rain though not all forecasts show it around Clatter.  I haven't suggested Shepherds Tump as it has a very sharp lip and difficult to launch PG's when the wind is SW,

\----------------------------------



Friday has light NW winds backing W during the day and probably increasing a bit around the Long Mynd, supposedly very thermic but it's getting late in the year, but with very cold arctic air it might be so.  It might be too light to ridge soar though, certainly at times by the look of current forecasts.

\--------------------------------------------

Today (Thursday) looks to be flyable at times, but with Towering Cu and showers the timings might be short.  Pretty windy so Long Mountain or Lawley by the look of things.  IT's west on the Mynd at present but as the air mixes it is due to go more NW, but it's worth checking the weather stations to see if it does.

\--------------------------------

Thursday around here looks probably often wet and also top end wind speed, certainly for PG's.  If dry enough then Long Mountain or lower Lawley launch look like the only options with my preference for Long Mountain for lower airtime ridge soaring as no risk if getting blown back unlike Lawley.

Friday much lighter and drier and looks reasonably likely to be soarable but less than perfect direction for the Mynd as could be a long way off the hill so maybe Camlo or Shepherds Tump may be lightly soarable during the day.

Sadly the weekend looks blown out again, except when it's raining !

\--------------------------------------------

I was hoping that Monday would be suitable for Long Mountain, but unless things improve in the next 24 hours (if it does I'll update and go there myself!), it looks blown out even for there.  Just maybe it might calm down mid afternoon for a short while if rasp can be believed.  Then it looks fairly unsettled and generally windy until Friday which is too far away to think about at this stage.

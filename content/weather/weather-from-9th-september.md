I was hoping that Monday would be suitable for Long Mountain, but unless things improve in the next 24 hours (if it does I'll update and go there myself!), it looks blown out even for there.  Just maybe it might calm down mid afternoon for a short while if rasp can be believed.  Then it looks fairly unsettled and generally windy until Friday which is too far away to think about at this stage.

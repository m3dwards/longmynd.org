Thursday around here looks probably often wet and also top end wind speed, certainly for PG's.  If dry enough then Long Mountain or lower Lawley launch look like the only options with my preference for Long Mountain for lower airtime ridge soaring as no risk if getting blown back unlike Lawley.

Friday much lighter and drier and looks reasonably likely to be soarable but less than perfect direction for the Mynd as could be a long way off the hill so maybe Camlo or Shepherds Tump may be lightly soarable during the day.

Sadly the weekend looks blown out again, except when it's raining !

\--------------------------------------------

I was hoping that Monday would be suitable for Long Mountain, but unless things improve in the next 24 hours (if it does I'll update and go there myself!), it looks blown out even for there.  Just maybe it might calm down mid afternoon for a short while if rasp can be believed.  Then it looks fairly unsettled and generally windy until Friday which is too far away to think about at this stage.

Wednesday through to Friday, winds gradually veering from NE to SE, light but there is a chance of it being scratchy soarable on Corndon and later in the week Wrekin.  At present, forecasts do suggest the hills will be clear, certainly by the afternoon.  Weekend windy then wet.

\-----------------------

All rather iffy the whole week while the high pressure lasts, causing so much murk, low cloud, fog, mist, light drizzle etc.  Having said that, if the cameras or looking out the window look good, then there could well be some flying possible,  most likely Corndon or Wrekin SE side as later in the week it is due to go more SE direction.  Conditions could be very local, but also do beware if flying, as mist can form quickly while you are in the air for just minutes.

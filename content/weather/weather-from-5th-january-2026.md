Monday looks a possibility, but a very marked wind gradient plus the wind has some forecasts showing a massive variation in wind direction with height, likely to create turbulence.  Also Rasp suggests wind will back during the day from N to W, but only at low levels making things more problematical.

Then a bit warmer but very cloudy with a chance of the Mynd on Wednesday, then rain after that.

Saturday at this moment looks like good ridge and thermal flying on our SW sites, though forecasts do vary on whether there will be any rain.  So Clatter or Shepherds Tump.

\----------------------------------

In time for May, it's April shower time.  So most of this week looks pretty rainy on and off.  At present Wednesday looks promising though for ridge soaring either Corndon or maybe Wrekin SE side.  And good for thermalling the further west you go.

RASP lapse charts have improved a bit for Tuesday, but likely to be windier, starting off NW and backing WNW.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

What a fabulous January flying month it hasn't been.  And it's set to continue.  Tuesday has light winds, but at present looks clagged in at or below Mynd launch height.

Thursday holds some chance of it being better air with cloud well above hilltop, but might be too windy - the forecasts are varying on direction and speed a lot at present.

Thursday, flyable but on the windier HG side at the Mynd by the look of it, though it might calm down a bit,  gradually backing WSW during the day with inversion level only about 2000ft.  Friday light winds but probably fog or clagged in.

\--------------------------------

RASP lapse charts have improved a bit for Tuesday, but likely to be windier, starting off NW and backing WNW.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

What a fabulous January flying month it hasn't been.  And it's set to continue.  Tuesday has light winds, but at present looks clagged in at or below Mynd launch height.

Thursday holds some chance of it being better air with cloud well above hilltop, but might be too windy - the forecasts are varying on direction and speed a lot at present.

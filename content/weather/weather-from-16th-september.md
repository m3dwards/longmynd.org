Friday a bit too windy even for HG, weekend wet Saturday windy Sunday.  

Next week holds some promise on a number of days.

\----------------------------------

Still windy, but there is just a small chance on Friday, maybe better for HG as expected to be top end for PG launching.  SW so Clatter could be on.  This all depends on the passage of a front, so it could still be rainy in Wales.

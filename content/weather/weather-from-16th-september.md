East winds, maybe NE, but light getting stronger and more likely to be ridge soarable during the week.  Don't even think about going to Corndon in the morning, it will be so inverted that even if the wind feels soarable it is likely to create very unpleasant soaring conditions, far better to wait until late afternoon when the inversion will be at it's highest with the air below more co-ordinated, safer and more pleasant as well as more soarable.

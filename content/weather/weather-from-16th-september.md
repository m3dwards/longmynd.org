Sunday 21st - yehh a nice day today if you're at the right site.  Approximately North in our area and quite breezy.  Long Mountain looks the most suited for reliable ridge soaring.  Red Hopton if it is windy enough looks good, or Corndon and maybe Wrekin.  Though Wrekin could well be too windy for safe launching.  Very thermic for the time of the year in the afternoon with cloudbase well over 4000ft.

\---------------------------

Friday a bit too windy even for HG, weekend wet Saturday windy Sunday.  

Next week holds some promise on a number of days.

\----------------------------------

Still windy, but there is just a small chance on Friday, maybe better for HG as expected to be top end for PG launching.  SW so Clatter could be on.  This all depends on the passage of a front, so it could still be rainy in Wales.

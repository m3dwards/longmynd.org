Thursday looked like it was going to be full of showers and thunder, but so far not as bad as expected but light winds but is raining in many isolated locations.  Friday windier with no current expectation of cu-nims and more likely to be ridge soarable, especially in the west, though frontal conditions moving in could spoil that.  Clatter should be soarable as well as Shepherds Tump.  The mynd is a bit lighter and probably too far off the hill to be soarable but is in better air for longer in the day.

\---------------------------------------------

Wednesday sees winds roughly SW/WSW veering West during the day, soarable speeds but a good chance of some rain caused by towering Cu or Cu Nimbus.  Depending on the cloud development I think there's quite a few sites that could be suitable.  Camlo, Clatter, Shepherds Tump, Long Mynd.  Maybe late evening after the clouds die down if it stays windy enough, the Mynd might be suitable for some scratchy gentle soaring. 

\--------------------------------

Tuesday - after the rain, it looks like there will be a soaring opportunity at the long Mynd.  There is still the risk of a cunim developing, but I think the sky should be clear enough to see them building and avoid.  It's due to rapidly back to a west direction heralding the drier air.  Looking at the weather stations at present that seems unlikely, but that's what the forecasts say!

\------------------------------------------

Monday has a bit of a variation in forecasts relating to rain, some say none, others say showers.  Other than that it's due to be a fairly fresh SW wind with decent cloudbase and looks ideal for HG's at Clatter, but might well be too strong for PG launching.  On the one hand the CAPE index for likelyhood of big clouds/Cunim development is not that high around here, but lapse charts do still indicate CuNim development, so it's luck of the draw on what happens locally.

Tuesday and Wednesday look fairly rainy, but Thursday could be a Long Mynd day, but still some rain chance

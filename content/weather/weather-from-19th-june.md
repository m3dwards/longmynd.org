Tuesday - after the rain, it looks like there will be a soaring opportunity at the long Mynd.  There is still the risk of a cunim developing, but I think the sky should be clear enough to see them building and avoid.  It's due to rapidly back to a west direction heralding the drier air.  Looking at the weather stations at present that seems unlikely, but that's what the forecasts say!

\------------------------------------------

Monday has a bit of a variation in forecasts relating to rain, some say none, others say showers.  Other than that it's due to be a fairly fresh SW wind with decent cloudbase and looks ideal for HG's at Clatter, but might well be too strong for PG launching.  On the one hand the CAPE index for likelyhood of big clouds/Cunim development is not that high around here, but lapse charts do still indicate CuNim development, so it's luck of the draw on what happens locally.

Tuesday and Wednesday look fairly rainy, but Thursday could be a Long Mynd day, but still some rain chance

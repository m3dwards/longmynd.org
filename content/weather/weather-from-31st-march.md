Still a howling gale over the weekend, maybe Sunday on Corndon for HG for anyone who cares to carry up.

\--------------------------------------------------------

At this moment Monday looks like the only potential day but even then unsuited to ridge soaring, as too light and most forecasts have it as SSE or SE direction on Corndon.  Rest of the week blown out, but hopefully at least one day might be light enough to launch.

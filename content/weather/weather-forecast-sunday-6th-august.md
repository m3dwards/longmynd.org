Monday 7th August, a ridge of high pressure building from the west so "another day of sunny spells and scattered showers, though showers focused more towards the north and east of the UK" according to the Met Office. 

RASP suggesting a good soaring day with cloudbase rising to 4000ft before mid day and surface winds W 9kts, so it could be strong and gusty on take off. We are likely to see cloud building in the afternoon with cloudbase dropping.  

Met Office says that "Tuesday will be rather cloudy, with outbreaks of rain and drizzle". RASP suggesting lighter winds, starting WSW backing more S before veering NNW later, a case of look and see but a much more stable day than Monday. 

"Drier and brighter on Wednesday and Thursday, with just a few showers possible. Temperatures rising, feeling much warmer". RASP for Wednesday suggesting light SW winds in the morning veering more W later with more soarable conditions in the afternoon. 

By Thursday we may see the arrival of another low brought courtesy of the Jetstream with high pressure to the E so things not looking a lot better yet.

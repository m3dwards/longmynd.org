Some might be able to fly at Corndon today, ENE and pretty windy,  due to be clear of cloud this afternoon.  It's not an ideal direction or speed, but much of the wind does tend to funnel around the hill.  Low airtimers, please take head of the site rules especially the briefing requirements.

Then too windy until maybe Friday.

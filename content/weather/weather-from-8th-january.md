Sunday looks flyable in between the cold front's moving through, so the gaps might be quite short.  West veering NNW during the day with some rain, possibly lunchtime, but that;s not exact.  Could be on the windy side for some PG's.  So Mynd this morning, but might be too far off later and Long Mountain, Lawley or Wrekin might be better - the further north you go the earlier the front may pass if it's come through.  Last night there were two cold front's due today but I think they may have joined looking at the most recent detail.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday looks a bit iffy on the basis that the lapse charts show west at low level but north east higher up and fairly light winds anyway.  Sunday looks a bit more promising as generally WNW and stronger with a better lapse chart.  Next week looks even better.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

All the forecasts today show it as clagged in, yet Corndon is clear on the webcam, so just might be flyable, especially if the wind drops a little.

Friday is now looking too light and also clagged in - so who knows!

Saturday too light, Sunday more promising and west.

\----------------------------------------------

Some might be able to fly at Corndon today, ENE and pretty windy,  due to be clear of cloud this afternoon.  It's not an ideal direction or speed, but much of the wind does tend to funnel around the hill.  Low airtimers, please take head of the site rules especially the briefing requirements.

Then too windy until maybe Friday.

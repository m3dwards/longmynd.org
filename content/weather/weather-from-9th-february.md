There is still forecast to be a short interlude in the miserable damp weather on Saturday with light to moderate NW winds and thermic with cloudbase 4000ft - might change but all forecasts seem to broadly agree.

Slight chance that the wind goes North or North West later in the week and might be dry for a while

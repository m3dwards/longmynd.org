Still promising for Saturday with inversion rising to 4500ft and thermic in cool air. Quite light winds in Wales and all due to back from NW to SW during the day, Mynd most likely at this moment for flying I think.

\----------------------------

There is still forecast to be a short interlude in the miserable damp weather on Saturday with light to moderate NW winds and thermic with cloudbase 4000ft - might change but all forecasts seem to broadly agree.

\------------------------------------------------------

Slight chance that the wind goes North or North West later in the week and might be dry for a while

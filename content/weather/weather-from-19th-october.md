Saturday, pretty yucky and very low base but just might be flyable especially late afternoon - forecasts vary between NW and NE though

Sunday nice air but quite windy, maybe ok for HG at the Long Mynd but a long way off the right direction, PG gale hanging there or maybe try Shepherds Tump which will take WSW.

Sorry I missed forecasting Monday's nice weather, family health issues came first so hadn't looked at any forecasts.

Sunday 22nd looks possible, SW wind and dry, but with so many front's in close proximity it's too far away to call

Tuesday starts off w to wnw but due to veer more nw later.  looks good for pg and hg but may get a bit strong for pg's mid afternoon.  some chance of showers but generally dry with base 4000ft or so

\---------------------------------

Monday looks possible now, from Corndon or Red Hopton this afternoon, as the rain clears from the north.  Fairly breezy until late on, then maybe Llangollen, but possibly blown out earlier in the afternoon.  Long Mountain possibly but not ideal direction being N with a bit of E in it maybe.

Monday looks possible now, from Corndon or Red Hopton this afternoon, as the rain clears from the north.  Fairly breezy until late on, then maybe Llangollen, but possibly blown out earlier in the afternoon.  Long Mountain possibly but not ideal direction being N with a bit of E in it maybe.

\-------------------------------------------

Tuesday at present looks like a Mynd day,  could get a bit strong for PG's,  we'll see a bit closer to the day.

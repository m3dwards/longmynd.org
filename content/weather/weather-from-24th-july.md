Thursday west but too much for PG at the Mynd by the lok of things - low cloudbase but might be ok for HG.

Friday SW and same sort of wind speed, better air and might be on at Clatter for HG

Weekend blown out for all

\------------------------

Wednesday starts off great with decent SW winds ideal for Clatter and Shepherds Tump, but quite rapidly a front (in fact it grows to multiple fronts) is due to move in and winds increase, ;ayer cloud filling the sky with the chance of a bit of drizzle.  So if you want to fly go early.  Tuesday - still time for some to get to the Mynd to fly this evening as it's working at present.

\-----------------------------------------

Tuesday starts off w to wnw but due to veer more nw later.  looks good for pg and hg but may get a bit strong for pg's mid afternoon.  some chance of showers but generally dry with base 4000ft or so.  late evening, backing more west and reducing for Mynd soaring.

\---------------------------------

Monday looks possible now, from Corndon or Red Hopton this afternoon, as the rain clears from the north.  Fairly breezy until late on, then maybe Llangollen, but possibly blown out earlier in the afternoon.  Long Mountain possibly but not ideal direction being N with a bit of E in it maybe.

\-------------------------------------------

Tuesday at present looks like a Mynd day,  could get a bit strong for PG's,  we'll see a bit closer to the day.

The end of the week looks a possibility, with the run of weather it's probably going to be SW direction, so as this past Saturday turned out, the Mynd not the best place to be.  For those that haven't been before, worth trying Clatter or Shepherds Tump instead of just heading to the usual Long Mynd launch in the hope for a flight.  Shepherds Tump if very SW in direction can easily get blown out for launching as it is very steep, much more so than other sites and with a sharp lip at the top launch area, Clatter is easier in that respect but will not tolerate even WSW direction whereas Shep' will take direction variations and an easier launch slope if WSW.

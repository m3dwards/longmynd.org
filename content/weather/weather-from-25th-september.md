Today looks HG flyable at Clatter, blown out of PG.  Quite cloudy.  Friday post cold frontal but now looks on the slightly windy side again.  Saturday has big variations in forecasts so could be good for Mynd or might be southerly.

\-----------------------------------------------------

Thursday could just possibly be flyable, more for HG as the wind increases a great deal with height, and cloudbase is due to be low as well.  

Friday is looking like a Mynd soaring day at this moment, wind speed forecasts have reduced a lot, so looks PG speeds now.  Cloudbase not great but ok for the ridge.  forecasts vary on direction a bit so could be anywhere between WSW and NW.

As an aside, for a long time I have usually discounted Met Office forecasts, an example today - met rain radar says no rain happening within best part of 100 miles from me, yet I could hardly hear myself think for the rain hammering on the conservatory roof.  Another website showed the rain radar accurately.

\----------------------------------------------------

Friday looks like a hang gliding day on the Mynd.  Saturday might be flyable at the Wrekin or just maybe Corndon.

\---------------------------------------------

The end of the week looks a possibility, with the run of weather it's probably going to be SW direction, so as this past Saturday turned out, the Mynd not the best place to be.  For those that haven't been before, worth trying Clatter or Shepherds Tump instead of just heading to the usual Long Mynd launch in the hope for a flight.  Shepherds Tump if very SW in direction can easily get blown out for launching as it is very steep, much more so than other sites and with a sharp lip at the top launch area, Clatter is easier in that respect but will not tolerate even WSW direction whereas Shep' will take direction variations and an easier launch slope if WSW.

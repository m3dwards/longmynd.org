Wednesday probably too windy even for HG - wind WSW though it is due to be dry.

Thursday looks more likely to be light soarable conditions but the forecasts vary in direction between W and N at present.  Friday a possibility and the weekend is looking promising on some forecasts but quite wet on others.

\---------------------------------------------

Today looks flyable and should be dry though there is a chance of the occasional shower.  Direction is due to be S but likely to back SE much later on which will be a benefit on the Wrekin.  Corndon isn't a great ridge soaring site  on the south side, the Wrekin can be though better in SSE to SE direction unless windy when SE can make it more turbulent due to the hill in front.

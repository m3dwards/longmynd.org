Sunday has winds forecast to be either from West or could be North, depends which forecast you believe.  What does get agreed on is lack of decent thermals and soarable wind strength, as does look rather on the light side.  limited chance of some drizzle mid day or after.  Not great but not awful either.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday has many variations on the theme of wind strength and to some extent direction.  Somewhere between W and N, but mostly forecasts say NW and light maybe just about soarable.  Thermic from early on with very unstable air.  Fortunately early on high level cloud is likely to limit the heating, as later on the cloud development with towering cu to 15000ft or so will majorly impact flying conditions.  Rain forecasts vary but there is a chance some of those big clouds will dump and a chance of lightening.  Possibly windier at Wrekin making ridge soaring easier.

Sunday drier but still showing as light winds

\=================================

Saturday and Sunday now looking too light for any ridge soaring around our sites.

\------------------------------

Friday see ok winds but an increasing chance of a thunderstorm later on, but only a relatively low risk.  Winds may change due to risk of big clouds affecting things but wind is due to be NE backing NW during the day.

Saturday has a much higher Cape index which means the chance of thunderstorms is higher still.  Winds light NW. Sunday looks nice, dry with moderate SW - WSW winds.

\---------------------------------

Wednesday probably too windy even for HG - wind WSW though it is due to be dry.

Thursday looks more likely to be light soarable conditions but the forecasts vary in direction between W and N at present.  Friday a possibility and the weekend is looking promising on some forecasts but quite wet on others.

\---------------------------------------------

Today looks flyable and should be dry though there is a chance of the occasional shower.  Direction is due to be S but likely to back SE much later on which will be a benefit on the Wrekin.  Corndon isn't a great ridge soaring site  on the south side, the Wrekin can be though better in SSE to SE direction unless windy when SE can make it more turbulent due to the hill in front.

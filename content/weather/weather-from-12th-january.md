Wednesday today looks possible, but there is a very strong wind gradient and a low level inversion.  Possible sites - Wrekin SE, but beware the wind gradient, not a place to get blown back.  Corndon south side is not the greatest place to ridge soar as a small and not steep everywhere slope, but is a much safer place to do it than Corndon when there is a chance of too strong a wind.

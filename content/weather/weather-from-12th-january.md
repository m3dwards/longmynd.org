Saturday has a small chance of some flying, but with a low level inversion and a good chance of fog or low cloud/Orographic.  Wind speeds and direction SE probably ok on Corndon or Wrekin.

\--------------------------------------------

Wednesday today looks possible, but there is a very strong wind gradient and a low level inversion.  Possible sites - Wrekin SE, but beware the wind gradient, not a place to get blown back.  Corndon south side is not the greatest place to ridge soar as a small and not steep everywhere slope, but is a much safer place to do it than Corndon when there is a chance of too strong a wind.

Friday, not great but probably better than the weekend, though there is still a chance of towering Cu or CuNim development today.  Breezy and NE to ENE direction but might be ok at Corndon as it needs a bit of wind, but just as likely to be blown out as not.  Probably clagged in until lunchtime.

\---------------------

Wednesday has change a lot,  looks flyable for a while but a chance of rain later,  winds varying during the day from between W and N, and varying locally a lot too.  check the weaher stations.

\-----------------------

Tuesday, forecasts have varied wildly but it now looks on for the Mynd with Wednesday maybe Corndon.

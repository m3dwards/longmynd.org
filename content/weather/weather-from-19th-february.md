Its due to be light west at the Mynd, better wind than most other places, but at present it's totally south.  Assuming it comes on a bit, it could be ok for some scratchy soaring and thermals, but the expected base being only 2000ft, they won't go up very far.  Road likely to be icy on the way up for a good few hours yet

\-------------------

Friday on at the Mynd, but with a fair chance of some showers but especially take care for very big clouds to 25,000ft.  Wind reducing during the late afternoon to nicer PG speeds.

Saturday now not looking so great as cloudbase not forecast much above the Mynd and likely to be mostly WSW direction,  quite light speeds, probably soarable.

\-----------------------------------------

Saturday now promising for HG and PG - we can but hope anyway!

\---------------------------------------------------------------

Pretty grotty yet again.  There may be the odd moment ok for Hang Gliders, but looks generally too windy for most Paragliders.

NE on Monday, forecasts vary a fair bit on speed but probably ok but not great direction with only Corndon and really isn't a good direction.  Tuesday looks far better for soaring, somewhere close to Nort and quite breezy.  Long Mountain as long as not E of N, otherwise Corndon or if that is blown out - Red Hopton.  Please note that Red Hopton is currently Pilot rated plus 100 hours, please see site guide for full details about the site.

After that forecasts vary just so much I'm not sure,  could be good, or rainy and too windy later in the week or just right, wait and see I think.

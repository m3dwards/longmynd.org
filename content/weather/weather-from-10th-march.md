Sunday has lighter winds, hardly any at present but increasing through the dy.  generally NE but I think fairly likely to have enough east in it to be soarable on Corndon.  it is misty but won't be for long.

\----------------------------------------------------\
Saturday quite windy, but actuals don't tie in with forecasts at present, could be anywhere between N and E, either of those might be soarable on Corndon if not blow out, but NE is worst of all.

Sunday similar but light winds so probably more suited to soaring.

\-------------------------------

Thursday maybe a bit windy,  Long Mountain, but maybe Corndon as it takes a lot more wind than many sites, Friday looks better wind but worse NE direction.  Weekend may be promising

\---------------------------

NE on Monday, forecasts vary a fair bit on speed but probably ok but not great direction with only Corndon and really isn't a good direction.  Tuesday looks far better for soaring, somewhere close to Nort and quite breezy.  Long Mountain as long as not E of N, otherwise Corndon or if that is blown out - Red Hopton.  Please note that Red Hopton is currently Pilot rated plus 100 hours, please see site guide for full details about the site.

After that forecasts vary just so much I'm not sure,  could be good, or rainy and too windy later in the week or just right, wait and see I think.

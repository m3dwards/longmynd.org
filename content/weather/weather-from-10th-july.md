Thursday was flyable at the Mynd from quite early on for PG's and in the afternoon mostly HG as it got pretty strong by 2pm.  Not a great looking sky despite forecast promises of it breaking up to be sunny so I don't think anyone went Cross Country but lots of soaring and thermalling done by many.  Some thought it rather strong and bumpy on HG's others were fine.

No chance for anyone anywhere around here until middle of next week

\===================================

Wednesday not very nice, windy and often wet.  Thursday looks a lot better, especially for HG due to wind speed, but might be suitable for PG's some of the time.  Quite a lot of mid level cloud likely to restrict thermal strength, but in between strong thermic air.  Wind direction between WSW and W, so even though not ideally on for the Long mynd, will probably be ridge soarable.  Cloudbase around 4000ft with some lumpy cumulus rising a few thousand feet but not massive.  Alternatively Camlo looks good and may be more suited as there is a fairly shallow WSW facing slope to launch from.

\------------------------------------------------------

Pretty wet and windy most of the time.  There might be a chance Wednesday and Thursday, but not looking very promising really for Wednesday due to chance of rain.  Fingers crossed that Thursday is a Mynd day.

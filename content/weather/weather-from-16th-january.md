Camera's both back up, but not showing on website yet - but if you click on the link to previou images, they are there.  Hopefully this issue will be fixed soon.  Despite being thoroughly cleaned the North image is still poor.

It's windy now as expected.

\----------------------------------------------------------

It is just about ok at the Mynd at present but due to get a lot stronger.  I'm about to take the weather station pole and cameras down, so don't believe the weather data until it's all back up and cameras working again.  It is just about passable up the Burway despite the road closed sign, but I don't fancy trying to go down it again.

\------------------------------------------

Tuesday is due to be SW direction and get pretty windy but nice air, maybe not as good as yesterday but still thermic.  Yesterday started off really light but as the thermals mixed the air it became very windy - though climbs were reported as being solid 3M/S so very much spring like conditions.  Clatter could be ok, especially for HG.  Shepherds tump has a very steep slope and sharp lip making PG launching difficult when windy.

Wednesday NE and Thursday Westerly and lighter so Mynd may be on if the roads are passable.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

Its due to Veer towards the north today and be windier than previously forecast.  At this moment it looks like Long Mountain ideal if NW or Red Hopton (only if it's fairly well North for Pilot rated only).  Rasp is showing an oddcalm patch with poor air around Long Mountain and Lawley - I'm guessing here, but it's either wave effect of the mountains upwind or warn sea or coming in through Cheshire basin.  

\----------------------------

Monday looks post cold frontal NNW to N direction and fairly brisk wind but clear air with cloudbase possibly 4000ft if it all works out.

So options will be Long Mountain, Red Hopton (if there's a good breeze on either of those), or Lawley, I think Wrekin might be blown out.  Corndon only if it's fully north, but if it's top end or blown out on top then Red Hopton is likely to be ideal.

Then Wednesday at present look like another good day

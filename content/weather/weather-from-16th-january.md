Monday looks post cold frontal NNW to N direction and fairly brisk wind but clear air with cloudbase possibly 4000ft if it all works out.

So options will be Long Mountain, Red Hopton (if there's a good breeze on either of those), or Lawley, I think Wrekin might be blown out.  Corndon only if it's fully north, but if it's top end or blown out on top then Red Hopton is likely to be ideal.

Then Wednesday at present look like another good day

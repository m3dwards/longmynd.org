Monday looks post cold frontal NNW to N direction and fairly brisk wind but clear air with cloudbase possibly 4000ft if it all works out.

So options will be Long Mountain, Red Hopton (if there's a good breeze on either of those), or Lawley, I think Wrekin might be blown out.

Then Wednesday at present look like another good day

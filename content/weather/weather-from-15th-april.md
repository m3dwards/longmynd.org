It's light NE wind at present, but it will back and switch west relatively quickly and increase in speed.  Thermic from early on but mid level cloud will come over and increase during the day.  However the thermal strengths will not reduce straight away, what will be more of a problem is the increasing wind speed, so HG's will be able to continue flying a lot longer.   Cloudbase high, 5000ft plus by mid morning but actually reducing as the poor air comes in, even though the thermal strengths will continue to increase for a while.

\---------------------------------------------

Thursday looks flyable at the Long Mynd for HG and PG, but at present most forecasts suggest blown out for PG's by around lunchtime, but don't bank on that being the case.  Significantly thermic and turbulent conditions in this post frontal cold air and wind is not expected to die down enough in the evening to make for good ridge soaring conditions.  An alternative site may be Llandinam, but the afternoon wind also likely to be stronger.

Saturday looking nice light-ish winds from the North and very thermic with good cloudbase.  Corndon looks on, or experimental site Red Hopton but it may be too light for that site as it tends to need a decent wind at the point that Corndon is blown out.

Sunday maybe on too.

\--------------------------------------------------

Well, obviously not flyable today, but later this week and the weekend is looking a lot more hopeful.  In fact it might be too light to ridge soar - what light winds, no that can't be possible, we don't do light winds any more?

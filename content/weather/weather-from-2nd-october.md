Sunday has light/moderate winds, nominally from the SW, but the upper winds above inversion are due to be more west.  The inversion or multiple inversions are very very low, so the Mynd may well be above them for some of the day.  not great but stands a chance of being launchable and in fact our SW sites or the Mynd might be suitable.

\-------------------

As usual too windy again.  Could be a chance around here from mid-week certainly for HG and possibly PG but not looking like a great forecast despite the nice warm weather.

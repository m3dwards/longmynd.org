Monday has what is supposed to be a mostly Southerly wind, maybe heading towards SW certainly at flying altitudes.  Therefore the natural site choices would be Camlo or Clatter.  However at present is mostly more east so maybe Corndon or Wrekin may be on.  fairly decent wind due later so should be ridge soarable if you are on the right hill.

Thursday (today) has forecasts varying due to the differing opinions from models of the progress of the front.  However, there may be times to ridge soar our sites, either Corndon, or our NW sites, or even nearby Long Mountain.

Friday is due to be westerly all day, possibly a bit breezy around Mynd and just to the West.  Looks good for HG and probably PG most of the day, with some good evening soaring possible.  Expected to be very thermic and turbulent during the middle of the day.  Make the most of it as the weekend looks poor at present.

\-------------------------------------------------

As expected, changed a lot since yesterday.  Tuesday looks too light to ridge soar, but just maybe late evening on at the Mynd.  Wednesday apart from rain in the day a decent north wind, Corndon, Long Mountain or Red Hopton to soar.  Friday currently on at the Mynd but don't bank on it yet.

\================

We are now entering a transition period as the long standing high pressure moves away.  The various forecasts I look at are starting to disagree a lot on what is due to happen.  For instance on Monday and Tuesday some have localised or general heavy rain showers, others have none at all.  Some have towering Cu - not Cu-Nims but big, others have nice Cu or none.

So with that in mind, it's probably a soarable day at Corndon today and tomorrow. Wednesday or Thursday might be a Mynd day, weekend blown out - but that could all change!

As expected, changed a lot since yesterday.  Tuesday looks too light to ridge soar, but just maybe late evening on at the Mynd.  Wednesday apart from rain in the day a decent north wind, Corndon, Long Mountain or Red Hopton to soar.  Friday currently on at the Mynd but don't bank on it yet.

\================

We are now entering a transition period as the long standing high pressure moves away.  The various forecasts I look at are starting to disagree a lot on what is due to happen.  For instance on Monday and Tuesday some have localised or general heavy rain showers, others have none at all.  Some have towering Cu - not Cu-Nims but big, others have nice Cu or none.

So with that in mind, it's probably a soarable day at Corndon today and tomorrow. Wednesday or Thursday might be a Mynd day, weekend blown out - but that could all change!

Monday is supposed to be howling, but at this moment not as much as forecast.  Most likely it will end up pretty well North or just west of North and the only options around here for safe launching of PG's will be Long Mountain or Red Hopton (for those suitably experienced to analyse and report on site conditions).  HG could be ok from Llangollen, maybe.  Weather stations have been intermittently offline today, and they are not on the same service provider, so I can only guess it's weather related?

Tuesday looking good for both ridge soaring and thermals, with it starting off west for the Mynd but veering NW to N

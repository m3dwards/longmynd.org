Tuesday sees light winds increasing to ridge soaring speeds in the late afternoon, with more wind at the Wrekin than other sites.  The wind is due to vary between NW and N or even occasionaly NNE.  The infamous Chechire Basin effect is expected to bring in sea air to significanlty reduce the thermalling but improve the ridge soaring conditions.  Sites protected from this effect are Llandinam, Lan Fawr, Clunbury should have better thermalling conditions for longer but much less wind.  Lawley I'm not sure about, it does get influenced in the same manner as the Wrekin, sometimes more as the air sweeps along the river plains, but its high and long and gives more ridge soaring chances and is a good thermalling place.  Corndon will be ok if it's completely north or NNE wind, but not great for ridge soaring but an ok thermalling launch point.

Monday is supposed to be howling, but at this moment not as much as forecast.  Most likely it will end up pretty well North or just west of North and the only options around here for safe launching of PG's will be Long Mountain or Red Hopton (for those suitably experienced to analyse and report on site conditions).  HG could be ok from Llangollen, maybe.  Weather stations have been intermittently offline today, and they are not on the same service provider, so I can only guess it's weather related?

Tuesday looking good for both ridge soaring and thermals, with it starting off west for the Mynd but veering NW to N

Thursday is somewhere between a bit light to ridge soar and just right.  Direction is due to be between NNE and NE so site choice is difficult - Corndon ok in a NNE but NE means it's right on the rocky corner and rubbish for soaring.  However it's currently NNW in some places so may stay north, the upper winds at inversion level are due to be North all day, it's just the lower winds that have the easterly component.  Inversion due to rise to 4000ft, so again in these high pressure days, later is better in the day.  I would not recommend it as a good site choice, but I flew Caer Caradoc the other day in a north wind and it was soarable just about, but beware the nice bottom landing fields are all in long crop and the rest nearby are strewn with high tension power cables.  Red Hopton would be a safer option if its basically north, for those with the required experience level (see site guide),

Wednesday looks to be better than Tuesday turned out.  It's supposed to be northerly but at present has a fair bit of west in it.  Due to get stronger so at present the most likey option is Long Mountain unless it goes really very north then Corndon or Red Hopton may be suitable.  Despite the rasp star rating being zero around here the lapse charts indicate it being thermic with an inversion getting up to near 4000ft later on.  It's a toss up between flying earlier when the inversion is lower but maybe less windy and later when smoother but windier.  My preference would be later, you can always assess the wind on the ground as suitable to launch, but if it's turbulent once in the air it's a bit late to make that decision and low inversions always create turbulence.

Thursday, light northerlies and thermic

Friday light/moderate easterlies and thermic

Tuesday sees light winds increasing to ridge soaring speeds in the late afternoon, with more wind at the Wrekin than other sites.  The wind is due to vary between NW and N or even occasionaly NNE.  The infamous Chechire Basin effect is expected to bring in sea air to significanlty reduce the thermalling but improve the ridge soaring conditions.  Sites protected from this effect are Llandinam, Lan Fawr, Clunbury should have better thermalling conditions for longer but much less wind.  Lawley I'm not sure about, it does get influenced in the same manner as the Wrekin, sometimes more as the air sweeps along the river plains, but its high and long and gives more ridge soaring chances and is a good thermalling place.  Corndon will be ok if it's completely north or NNE wind, but not great for ridge soaring but an ok thermalling launch point.

Monday is supposed to be howling, but at this moment not as much as forecast.  Most likely it will end up pretty well North or just west of North and the only options around here for safe launching of PG's will be Long Mountain or Red Hopton (for those suitably experienced to analyse and report on site conditions).  HG could be ok from Llangollen, maybe.  Weather stations have been intermittently offline today, and they are not on the same service provider, so I can only guess it's weather related?

Tuesday looking good for both ridge soaring and thermals, with it starting off west for the Mynd but veering NW to N

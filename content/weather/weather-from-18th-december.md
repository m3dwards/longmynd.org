Tuesday afternoon might be just about ok at the Long Mynd for Hang Gliders but probably too strong for Paragliders as the wind is due to be 40Mph not far above the hill and between NW and WNW.  Other than that it is supposed to dry out nicely and the higher cloud to thin out a lot.  I would say Long Mountain could have been a possibility, the wind is due to back west at it clears, so that will make it unsuitable.

The rest of the week and weekend is ideal for Christmas parties and shopping, but not flying.

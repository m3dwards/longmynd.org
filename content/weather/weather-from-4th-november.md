Thursday might offer a chance of soaring at the Wrekin,  wind speed looks ok, and in the afternoon the hill is due to be clear of cloud, but only by a small margin.  Friday more likely to be clear air, a bit more east in the wind but inversion is even lower.

Next week promises to be clearer northern cooler airmass so might be better, i hope.

\---------------------------------------

Monday might clear enough to fly Corndon or Wrekin, but if it does, it's liekly to be late on.  Then, for most of the rest of the week, forecasts vary but generally too light to ridge soar even if it clears enough to see.  End of the week and weekend, wind due to veer round to the west, but still be poor air.

Monday might clear enough to fly Corndon or Wrekin, but if it does, it's liekly to be late on.  Then, for most of the rest of the week, forecasts vary but generally too light to ridge soar even if it clears enough to see.  End of the week and weekend, wind due to veer round to the west, but still be poor air.

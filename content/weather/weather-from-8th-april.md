Now looking a fair bit better.  Thursday could be ok on our WSW/SW/SSW  sites - direction not entirely clear yet. Cloudbase not great but as long as not too strong ok for some ridge soaring.  Friday slightly better air but windier, so we'll see as things progress.

Sunday at present looks great for the Long Mynd, but 5 star XC days do not usually go hand in hand with good soaring conditions.

\--------------------------------------------------

Short and ugly review - it's still wet and windy.

I did think Friday might be on, but it's now looking windy as well, even for HG.

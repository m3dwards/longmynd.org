Sunday is looking ok for HG at the Long Mynd, with W backing WSW winds and increasing during the day.  For PG's it looks at present to be blown out, though not all lapse charts indicate to be that windy, but most ground level forecasts suggest it will be.  Some chance late afternoon for a bit of rain, but much brighter first thing.

\---------------------------------------------------------



Today (Thursday), not quite as promising now, but still might be ok - winds pretty well SW and stronger than previously forecast.  Cloudbase only getting to about 2500ft and over near Clatter there might be the odd bit of drizzle.  Forecasts vary slightly on how windy, seems ok for HG, but could be top end PG.  If not blown out it could provide some nice ridge soaring.  I think Shepherds Tump more likely to be blown out.

Sunday at present is blown out for the Mynd

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Now looking a fair bit better.  Thursday could be ok on our WSW/SW/SSW  sites - direction not entirely clear yet. Cloudbase not great but as long as not too strong ok for some ridge soaring.  Friday slightly better air but windier, so we'll see as things progress.

Sunday at present looks great for the Long Mynd, but 5 star XC days do not usually go hand in hand with good soaring conditions.

\--------------------------------------------------

Short and ugly review - it's still wet and windy.

I did think Friday might be on, but it's now looking windy as well, even for HG.

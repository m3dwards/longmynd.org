Monday looks like having a decent breeze suitable for ridge soaring Wrekin or Camlo - direction is supposed to be SE veering SSW.  Highly thermic so late afternoon will see smoother conditions.  If it goes SSW then Shepherds Tump may be ok.

Tuesday wind is due to be much lighter and from N to NNE direction so not looking good for ridge soaring any of our sites.  Not as thermic as Monday.  From then on possibly a breakdown in weather, so will have to wait to see how the forecasts shape up.

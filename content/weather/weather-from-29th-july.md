Saturday has the cold front passing through much later than forecast so likely to be a late start, but will become turbulent as the sun comes out.  Likely to be top end wind wise for some PG's during the day.  Evening looks good for some ridge soaring.

\-------------------------------------------

Thursday, despite the risk of thunderstorms in the midlands and south Wales, maybe Llandinam will be nicely soarable as the wind forecast there is reasonable and the right direction.

Friday might be a bit windy but better air and could be good for HG at Clatter

Saturday at present looks like a Mynd day for all.

\--------------------------------------------

Wednesday looks very thermic but late in the day, however wind speeds for ridge soaring look rather on the low side, maybe Wrekin is a better option than Corndon for both any ridge work or getting away in thermals as the wind is due to be less in the west.

Thursday might be flyable early on but a growing chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon.

\--------------------------------

Monday looks like having a decent breeze suitable for ridge soaring Wrekin or Camlo - direction is supposed to be SE veering SSW.  Highly thermic so late afternoon will see smoother conditions.  If it goes SSW then Shepherds Tump may be ok.

Tuesday wind is due to be much lighter and from N to NNE direction so not looking good for ridge soaring any of our sites.  Not as thermic as Monday.  From then on possibly a breakdown in weather, so will have to wait to see how the forecasts shape up.

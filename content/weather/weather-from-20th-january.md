Saturday still looking good, wind forecasts vary a bit in direction, either W-WSW or completely SW.   Inversion level about 4000ft and should actually be thermic in the middle of the day.  probably on at the Long Mynd, but Camlo, Shepherds tump could be a good alternative unless totally SW then Clatter.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday looks promising and has done for a couple of days now, clear and light/moderate winds probably SW direction.

\---------------------------------------

Tuesday now looks murky all day despite a gentle southerly breeze, marginally better air tomorrow but forecasts vary on wind, anywhere between nothing at all and light NW, maybe Lawley or Caer Caradoc might be scratchy soarable in that?

\----------------------------------

Interesting watching the clouds move from the North on the camera's yet the winds are southerly or WSW.

Monday is slightly brighter than forecast at present but not due to be soarable speeds, might be ok for some ground handling practice.  Tuesday holds more chance of wind.

Forecasts vary for Wednesday with a hint that it might be just about on somewhere - WNW to NW before the bad weather arrives later in the week.

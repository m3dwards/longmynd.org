Interesting watching the clouds move from the North on the camera's yet the winds are southerly or WSW.

Monday is slightly brighter than forecast at present but not due to be soarable speeds, might be ok for some ground handling practice.  Tuesday holds more chance of wind.

Forecasts vary for Wednesday with a hint that it might be just about on somewhere - WNW to NW before the bad weather arrives later in the week.

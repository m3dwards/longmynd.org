Saturday has light winds, going SE, probably too light to ridge soar and might not get properly clear of cloud, though there is a chance it might just about on Wrekin or Corndon.  Sunday expected to be marginally higher  base in early afternoon but forecasts vary on wind, probably again too light to soar on Corndon.

\=========================

Monday - didn't forecast as due to be wet.

Tuesday - today - best chance of the week at this moment, though inverted at a relatively low level (2000ft ish) but might be soarable.  Forecasts vary between NW and NNW but fairly light.  if the Mynd is not on, then walking to the top of the Lawley or Caer Caradoc look like good bets.  The wind is due to be slightly stronger further east so Wrekin might be on too.  For the  many that have never been up Caer Caradoc, it is very steep and works well in light winds, nice flat top to launch from and if it's stronger wind can be launched on the spine much lower down, the actual face is so steep it will make launching difficult.

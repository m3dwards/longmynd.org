Well, much of the same by the look of things.  Gradually deteriorating this week, getting a bit stronger with a lower inversion level, but it does look like coming more East than NE, so that's better for Corndon.  Today looks the most thermic and least windy, but it's already pretty windy on the weather stations at Mynd, Clatter and Lawley, but does seem to be reducing a little, maybe only suited for HG launches.  Much better chance later in the day though.

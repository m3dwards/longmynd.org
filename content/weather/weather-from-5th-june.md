Wednesday looks a nice Corndon day with the wind slightly less than last few days and pretty well east.  Inversion rising to 4000ft late afternoon and it's supposed to be sunny this afternoon - yesterday was too but it never cleared properly.

Well, much of the same by the look of things.  Gradually deteriorating this week, getting a bit stronger with a lower inversion level, but it does look like coming more East than NE, so that's better for Corndon.  Today looks the most thermic and least windy, but it's already pretty windy on the weather stations at Mynd, Clatter and Lawley, but does seem to be reducing a little, maybe only suited for HG launches.  Much better chance later in the day though.

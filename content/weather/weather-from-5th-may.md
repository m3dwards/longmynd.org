Thursday is possibly just about on the high side for Corndon, but it likes a decent blow - the good news is it is Easterly and due much of the day.  Friday is due to be very thermic in the day and turbulent, veering from E to SE during the day and a bit less wind so may or may not be nicely soarable on Corndon, forecasts vary a bit but may not be SE enough for Wrekin to work - it is often rough and poor lift when off too much to the East whereas it often copes well when off to the south.

Saturday - forecasts vary a lot - may be blown out or may be good, Sunday at present is most likely blown out and maybe raining.

\---------------------------------------

It's currently very light east but is due to be more NE during the day,  still, with that forecast Corndon is the only option and it could well be different direction than the forecasts so might be soarable later.

\----------------------------

Tuesday onwards, winds are probably soarable speed, but the direction is all wrong until the weekend, when at this moment it is due to go East.  Up to then the forecasts all suggest NE pretty well constantly.  Corndon will be launchable but it is very difficult to soar in that direction unless it has a decent amount of North or East in it.  Red Hopton will not be suitable to launch unless it is very close to North.

It's currently very light east but is due to be more NE during the day,  still, with that forecast Corndon is the only option and it could well be different direction than the forecasts so might be soarable later.

\----------------------------

Tuesday onwards, winds are probably soarable speed, but the direction is all wrong until the weekend, when at this moment it is due to go East.  Up to then the forecasts all suggest NE pretty well constantly.  Corndon will be launchable but it is very difficult to soar in that direction unless it has a decent amount of North or East in it.  Red Hopton will not be suitable to launch unless it is very close to North.

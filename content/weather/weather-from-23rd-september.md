Tuesday might be ok, certainly for HG at the Long Mynd, but some forecasts have it a bit on the windy side for PG's.  Damp underfoot but supposed to be dry in the air.  Not particularly thermic at all with a low cloudbase but it might turn out to be a nice ridge soaring day.  Then wet again until Friday /Saturday but again might be on the windy side.

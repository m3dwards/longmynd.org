Yesterday was a great day at the Mynd for many HG's, flyable also for a few PG's but was top end windy.  Nice and good to get some airtime in for those there, a long winter awaits.

Saturday is still looking promising, fingers crossed.

Forecasts were slightly wrong for today - it was supposed to be raining by now but Wrekin looks nice right now this morning.



\----------------------------------------------

Tuesday might be ok, certainly for HG at the Long Mynd, but some forecasts have it a bit on the windy side for PG's.  Damp underfoot but supposed to be dry in the air.  Not particularly thermic at all with a low cloudbase but it might turn out to be a nice ridge soaring day.  Then wet again until Friday /Saturday but again might be on the windy side.

Monday looks good,  wind backing from NNW to NNE during the day by most forecasts, N by lunchtime.  Corndon should be soarable, Red Hopton maybe too light for there.  If it stays NNW, Lawley, Caer Caradoc or Wrekin, but any hint too close or past north then not them.  Thermic with base well about 4000ft.

during the week going more NE or East so Corndon, but looks ok weather wise for soaring.

Saturday has quite strong winds, roughly SE but I think too much for safe launching at Wrekin,  Further west a bit more chance of drizzly rain anyway.  Sunday I have no confidence in the forecasts at present, most likely too light to ridge soar but anywhere between North and South winds!.

\------------

Friday looks much lighter winds than Wednesday & Thursday was at Corndon.  Due to be pretty well East but gradually veering SE during the afternoon.  Maybe Wrekin SE side might work later on too when Corndon expected to be less soarable.

Weekend not sure about yet due to the front coming through, but likely to be broadly Northerly winds

\--------------

Light winds not likely to be very ridge soarable until Thursday but then it looks good and east on the east face of Corndon which tends to soar best.

\-----------------------------------------------

Monday looks good,  wind backing from NNW to NNE during the day by most forecasts, N by lunchtime.  Corndon should be soarable, Red Hopton maybe too light for there.  If it stays NNW, Lawley, Caer Caradoc or Wrekin, but any hint too close or past north then not them.  Thermic with base well about 4000ft.

during the week going more NE or East so Corndon, but looks ok weather wise for soaring.

Friday looks not too bad, could be a bit windy for some PG's, so maybe Long Mountain is a good bet, however the forecasts and actuals indicate it's more Long Mynd but veering NW so check the weather stations as Long Mountain is not great when anything more west than fully NW.  Other than them,  Lawley lower launch maybe.

\-------------------

Thursday,  despite it looking ok at present, forecasts suggest Mynd will be a bit on the windy side for PG's today but ideal for HG.  A good chance of wave affecting conditions, so could be quite variable in the air.

\-----------------

Today Wednesday could be ok, Wrekin, Corndon Long Mountain, with it more like NW in the east o four are and more like N to NNE in the far west.

\-------------------------

Wednesday looks like an occluded front somewhere over or near us, so can't say what it's likely to be yet.  Thursday, light/moderate winds most likely NNE backing N.  Friday might be W but could be clagged in by at least one lapse chart.

\------------------------------

Wednesday and Thursday now looking promising for moderate winds and good air - direction anywhere between west and north-east.   The season is only just round the corner now, so you need to get out to practice and be comfortable with your kit again.

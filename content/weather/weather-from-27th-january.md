Today Wednesday could be ok, Wrekin, Corndon Long Mountain, with it more like NW in the east o four are and more like N to NNE in the far west.

\-------------------------

Wednesday looks like an occluded front somewhere over or near us, so can't say what it's likely to be yet.  Thursday, light/moderate winds most likely NNE backing N.  Friday might be W but could be clagged in by at least one lapse chart.

\------------------------------

Wednesday and Thursday now looking promising for moderate winds and good air - direction anywhere between west and north-east.   The season is only just round the corner now, so you need to get out to practice and be comfortable with your kit again.

Saturday has nice Long Mynd weather for HG, but likely to be blown out in the afternoon for PG.  Other possible options could be Camlo or Llandinam, maybe Camlo for PG too early on.  Chance of rain late in the afternoon,

Sunday has light SE winds, might be soarable on SE face of Wrekin.

\=========================================



Today, Thursday looks nicely flyable, though damp underfoot.  Forecasts vary a little with wind direction, if it's North or East of North then Corndon should be soarable.  Upper winds may have a bit more west of north and with the afternoon air mixing our NW sites may be useable, maybe Clunbury, Caer Caradoc or Lawley - Wrekin might be a better bet with a greater chance of NNW winds there possibly.  Cloudbase up to 4000ft

Friday nice and sunny but lower winds most likely from SW.  Weekend not sure about yet.

\---------------------------------------------------------

Monday might be ok at Camlo, the wind is due to be southerly and the south face can take a bit of a variation around that, also wind strength looks soarable, though there is the chance of towering Cu and rain showers maybe.

Then it looks changeable (ie. Wet), eventually going North with Friday looking a dry day (but it's too far away to plan on that), and going west for the weekend.

Monday might be ok at Camlo, the wind is due to be southerly and the south face can take a bit of a variation around that, also wind strength looks soarable, though there is the chance of towering Cu and rain showers maybe.

Then it looks changeable (ie. Wet), eventually going North with Friday looking a dry day (but it's too far away to plan on that), and going west for the weekend.

Today now forecast to be a lot lighter on Mynd.

\-------------

Sunday looks promising for the Mynd but might be top end for PG's and for HG's could be difficult getting up the top by car.

\-----------------------

Today- Tuesday does look on for Corndon as the wind is stronger than indicated yesterday, but direction less than perfect - but should I think be soarable.

\-----------------------------------

So difficult this time of year as the height of any cloud or inversion can become so low just be the slightest change   in temperature.

Monday somewhere between NE and ENE, so Corndon might be on - fairly breezy and the hill is clear of cloud at present.  Tuesday more likely lighter winds but clearer air and hiugher inversion.

Wednesday could be a Mynd day but the inversion level possibly below the hill so could be turbulent near the hill and maybe low cloud, not really sure though.

New years day, not sure yet but maybe NW and windy enough for Long Mountain.

Windy at present, but it is due to drop gradually during the day and back to the SW.  My guess is HG flyable  at the Mynd until late on, possibly being suitable for PG's in the afternoon.  Late afternoon our SW sites likely to be a better bet to ridge soar.

\--------------------------

Sunday forecasts are still varying massively, but all agree dry and not a howling gale.  will keep an eye on things as they settle to some consus of forecast opinion.

\-------------------

Forecasts vary massively for Sunday, but worth watching out for, possibly the best chance until middle of next week.

\-----------------------------

Tuesday looks to be the only day of the week.  Forecasts vary a bit with lighter wind in North Wales and some say North or just marginally east of North, other say N varying NNW.  Nice and dry (in the air if not on the ground), so options I think are Long Mountain if it is west of North and blowy up there.  Red Hopton if it's windy (forecast is for a bit more wind than Long Mountain) and anywhere roughly north as it takes a bit either side and is too windy for Corndon.  Lawley just might be ok too if west of north.  Corndon is better just slightly east of North and not too windy.

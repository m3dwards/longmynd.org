Tuesday looks to be the only day of the week.  Forecasts vary a bit with lighter wind in North Wales and some say North or just marginally east of North, other say N varying NNW.  Nice and dry (in the air if not on the ground), so options I think are Long Mountain if it is west of North and blowy up there.  Red Hopton if it's windy (forecast is for a bit more wind than Long Mountain) and anywhere roughly north as it takes a bit either side and is too windy for Corndon.  Lawley just might be ok too if west of north.  Corndon is better just slightly east of North and not too windy.

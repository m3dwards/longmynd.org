I think the risk of very rapidly developing Cu Nim development today is too great to recommend anyone flying even if conditions at the time seem ok.

Tuesday onwards looks a lot better but it may be too windy on Tuesday at Corndon, borderline at present.  Wednesday looks good then Thursday and Friday the winds are due to reduce a lot and even though supposedly excellent thermic and XC conditions are unlikely to be be suitable winds or conditions for ridge soaring.  Staying predominantly easterly for a while longer.  Isn't the Long Mynd a place we used to fly? ?

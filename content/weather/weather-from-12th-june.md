Friday is a deteriorating picture from the west with a front coming in.  Winds nicely soarable around here but as the day progresses the chance of rain and more particularly I think embedded Cunims above layer cloud to the west.  Better option is to stay as east as you can - Wrekin SE side.  If you do fly Corndon, then it should be good earlier morning and into early afternoon, but beware if the clouds do fill in what might be hiding up there.

\----------------------------------

I don't think Wednesday was as windy as expected around here.

Thursday is due to actually be lighter wind, but some cumulus clouds this afternoon and a very good thermic day, but less good for ridge soaring - Corndon

Friday looks like being a bit windier but SE, so Wrekin looks a soarable option - again thermic with clouds we can hope.

\------------

Wednesday looks good at Corndon to ridge soar and XC.  from the lapse charts it looks like no chance of Cu Nim development, thought BBC last night did suggest some limited rain downwind into Wales.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday still has a decent risk of Cu Nim's to over 30,000ft, but it's a lot better air and much less risk than the last three days.  Wind soarable between NE and SE but looks quite likely to be ok to soar east face of Corndon.  Cloud developing and unless it's a cu nim, cloudbase getting to over 5000ft, if it's a monster it will be much lower.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think the risk of very rapidly developing Cu Nim development today is too great to recommend anyone flying even if conditions at the time seem ok.

Tuesday onwards looks a lot better but it may be too windy on Tuesday at Corndon, borderline at present.  Wednesday looks good then Thursday and Friday the winds are due to reduce a lot and even though supposedly excellent thermic and XC conditions are unlikely to be be suitable winds or conditions for ridge soaring.  Staying predominantly easterly for a while longer.  Isn't the Long Mynd a place we used to fly? ?

Wednesday still looking ok, best air in N Wales though.  However forecasts still vary between no wind, nice soarable NW or easterly.  Only time will tell, but the general Synoptic view is the upper air is due to be NW in N Wales but by the time it gets to S Wales, it's N to NE.

\------------------------------------

Wednesday looking slightly better post cold frontal air, but light winds.  Virtually every forecast I've seen gives a different wind direction, at present it looks like suitable for some ground handling and TTB flights but not soarable, but that could well change in the next 24 hours.  

Weekend still looking a possibility.

\--------------------------------------------------

Wednesday shows some slight hope, only because it's sandwiched in between some bad weather.  Lapse charts at present don't look good though and forecast wind speeds may be light, but depending on timing it could all be no good anyway.  Just a hint that the weekend might be a bit better.

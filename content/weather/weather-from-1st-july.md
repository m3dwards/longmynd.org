Friday is looking positive on most forecasts now, the rain forecast has receded.  West backing SW or possibly veering back again and moderate speeds.  Weather is better the further north-east you are.  Looks on for the Long Mynd and maybe Camlo, Shepherds Tump.  Unfortunately at this moment the weekend looks wet and windy.

\-------------------------------------

Today (Tuesday),  I'm hoping that the forecast slight reduction in wind speed in the west of our area this afternoon allows Long Mountain to be flyable.  I could well be wrong as it's marginal anyway, but beggars can't be choosers with the forecast for the next couple of weeks.

\------------------------------------------

Forecasts say it's likely to be too windy for PG's today and Tuesday, but at present not as windy generally as expected so just maybe ok on our sites.  After that it is due to get too windy even for HG's.

Quite a low inversion at 2000ft today so don't expect any good thermal climbs, but could still be turbulent at ridge height.  Mynd only place as even windier further west.

Today (Tuesday),  I'm hoping that the forecast slight reduction in wind speed in the west of our area this afternoon allows Long Mountain to be flyable.  I could well be wrong as it's marginal anyway, but beggars can't be choosers with the forecast for the next couple of weeks.

\------------------------------------------



Forecasts say it's likely to be too windy for PG's today and Tuesday, but at present not as windy generally as expected so just maybe ok on our sites.  After that it is due to get too windy even for HG's.

Quite a low inversion at 2000ft today so don't expect any good thermal climbs, but could still be turbulent at ridge height.  Mynd only place as even windier further west.

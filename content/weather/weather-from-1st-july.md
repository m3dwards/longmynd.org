Forecasts say it's likely to be too windy for PG's today and Tuesday, but at present not as windy generally as expected so just maybe ok on our sites.  After that it is due to get too windy even for HG's.

Quite a low inversion at 2000ft today so don't expect any good thermal climbs, but could still be turbulent at ridge height.  Mynd only place as even windier further west.

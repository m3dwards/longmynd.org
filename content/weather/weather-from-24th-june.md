Monday sees winds that may be too light for regular ridge soaring.  Roughly south winds so not ideal for any site, however if really keen to try, then the options are - Camlo - it has a steep SSE facing slope.  Wrekin, despite it being not ideal direction does often soar ok when South, but if it goes west of south then probably won't work in the speeds we are forecast today.  Corndon - but unless it's quite blowy does not soar well at all.

Tuesday even lighter winds

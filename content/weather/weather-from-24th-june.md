Saturday looks like being a decent soaring day on the Mynd,  WSW to W, so might be a bit off to the south for easy soaring.  Light but supposdly soarable speeds.  Cloudy and not massively rough thermals so good for the less experienced hopefully.  Possibly later on some rain coming in from Wales.

Sunday windier and forecasts vary between being a bit windy and just right, but depends on direction, some say WNW and others NW, if NW then Long Mountain, but only if a good breeze and not WNW.  Otherwise try any of our NW or WNW facing sites.

\---------------------------------------------------

Monday sees winds that may be too light for regular ridge soaring.  Roughly south winds so not ideal for any site, however if really keen to try, then the options are - Camlo - it has a steep SSE facing slope.  Wrekin, despite it being not ideal direction does often soar ok when South, but if it goes west of south then probably won't work in the speeds we are forecast today.  Corndon - but unless it's quite blowy does not soar well at all.  If by chance it stays SW, then things are slightly better, with Shepherds which has a face that takes from SSW to SW really nicely in a lighter wind, though bottom landings are not massive and slope landing is difficult as so steep.  Clatter, is easier in the respect of going down. 

Tuesday even lighter winds

Still promising for today at Corndon,  forecasts look ok, but current winds are a bit high, but should moderate a little.

\----------------------------------------

Wednesday could be ok at Corndon - it's forecast to be pretty well East and clear of cloud and around about suitable wind speeds.

Saturday looks a Mynd day but for HG as quite breezy.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Can't find a reasonable day during the week, but maybe a hint of a chance at the weekend.

Too windy Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday has ok speed but probably too low cloud, Thursday and Friday clagged in.

The forecasts are varying very regularly and quite wildly, but Monday at present looks the only chance during the week.  Winds could be from zero to quite a lot and in absolutely any direction depending on whose forecasts you look at and at what time of the day on Monday.  It could be Rasp 6* or pretty naff,  but all this is still looking better than the rest of the week.

The forecasts are varying very regularly and quite wildly, but Monday at present looks the only chance during the week.  Winds could be from zero to quite a lot and in absolutely any direction depending on whose forecasts you look at and at what time of the day on Monday.  It could be Rasp 6* or pretty naff,  but all this is still looking better than the rest of the week.

Will look at the forecasts over the weekend and see what the day is looking like - that's mostly dependent on watching how the forecasts change - the less they change the greater the expected reliability is going to be.

We're currently showing as on the edge of the good weather but at least we have wind (SE maybe)

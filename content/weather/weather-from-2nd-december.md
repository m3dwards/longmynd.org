If you are local and can get there quick,  today looks nice air until mid afternoon - WSW backing S, so Clatter, Shepherds Tump or Camlo.  All could be on for a short while, but take car as by mid afternoon it's due to get very windy and that might happen quickly.

\-----------------

Today looks marginally better forecast - with light winds that just might be soarable on the Wrekin, less so on Corndon as due to be slightly lighter winds still and S to SSW there.  no increase with height of airspeed to if it's on the hill should not be blown out once in the air.  Wednesday less good, more wind but a ground level inversion and high cloud.  It's as good as it gets - Thursday onwards very very windy.

\---------

 Update,  not looking as good now for Tuesday or Wednesday, but the positive if there's any (not), is that the rest of the week is probably worse.  More likely to be low cloud but it could be clear but also with a fairly significant wind gradient and more like S or SSW at hill top height.

\------------------------------------------------

Tuesday and Wednesday look flyable this week.  At present Tuesday has a better looking lapse rate and no high cloud.  Looks good for Wrekin SE, and Wednesday possibly but more chance of a more southerly or SSW west wind and a low level inversion.  Wind speeds look about right both days to stand a chance of ridge soaring.  Rest of the week blown out or wet.

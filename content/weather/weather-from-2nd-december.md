Update,  not looking as good now for Tuesday or Wednesday, but the positive if there's any (not), is that the rest of the week is probably worse.  More likely to be low cloud but it could be clear but also with a fairly significant wind gradient and more like S or SSW at hill top height.

\------------------------------------------------

Tuesday and Wednesday look flyable this week.  At present Tuesday has a better looking lapse rate and no high cloud.  Looks good for Wrekin SE, and Wednesday possibly but more chance of a more southerly or SSW west wind and a low level inversion.  Wind speeds look about right both days to stand a chance of ridge soaring.  Rest of the week blown out or wet.

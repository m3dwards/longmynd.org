Tuesday and Wednesday look flyable this week.  At present Tuesday has a better looking lapse rate and no high cloud.  Looks good for Wrekin SE, and Wednesday possibly but more chance of a more southerly or SSW west wind and a low level inversion.  Wind speeds look about right both days to stand a chance of ridge soaring.  Rest of the week blown out or wet.

Sunday looks nice, but a bit top end wind wise for PG's on the Mynd during the middle part of the day.  Ok for HG's and nicely thermic with just a small chance of showers.  Drier further west I think, so Llandinam might be good too.  Stays fairly windy in the evening but with smoother less gusty conditions could be good for some ridge soaring late on.

\-------------------------------------------

Wednesday looks on for the Mynd or maybe Llandinam, though forecast wind speeds have increased during today and further west is due to be windier than the Mynd.  Cloudbase 4000ft or a bit above and between W and WNW pretty well all day with a lot of cloud cover reducing thermal strengths.  After Wednesday it looks naff for at least the next week.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

As expected, Tuesday is turning out still windy but showery, though it is due to be much drier this afternoon.  Long Mountain looks like the most reliable place to soar safely today.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Monday sees nice strong thermic conditions after the rain has fully passed, but pretty windy from NW direction.  some forecasts indicate it might be ok, but most say too windy for PG, but there's a slightly less windy area to the west of our area.  Maybe Long Mountain for both PG and HG.  Some large clouds to 10,000ft in between, so strong variations in wind speed likely.  

Similar on Tuesday with lower wind speeds but maybe a greater chance of showers.

Wednesday at this moment looks like a Long Mynd soaring day, possibly Thursday too.

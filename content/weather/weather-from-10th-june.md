Monday sees nice strong thermic conditions after the rain has fully passed, but pretty windy from NW direction.  some forecasts indicate it might be ok, but most say too windy for PG, but there's a slightly less windy area to the west of our area.  Maybe Long Mountain for both PG and HG.  Some large clouds to 10,000ft in between, so strong variations in wind speed likely.  

Similar on Tuesday with lower wind speeds but maybe a greater chance of showers.

Wednesday at this moment looks like a Long Mynd soaring day, possibly Thursday too.

Thursday should be ok at the Mynd later as the front moves east and cloudbase lifts a bit.

Friday has higher cloudbase, and more sun but the lapse chart for our SW facing sites isn't looking great with quite a lot of wind at flying heights.

\-----------------------------------

Improved a lot with cloudbase well above the hill tops if the lapse charts can be believed.

Wednesday nice but probably too windy,  worth checking weather stations to see if Long Mountain or Red Hopton are suitable though.

Thursday light/moderate roughly west winds so could be on for the Mynd

Friday possibly our SW sites.

\-------------------------------------------------

Monday at first glance looks ok - at ground level winds anyway, but lapse charts show a massive rise in wind speeds from a low level, so not so great after all.  There is a chance that HG's may be able to fly the Mynd especially later this afternoon as the wind is due to reduce late on.

Weekend looks possible as the high pressure builds but could give rise to mist and low cloud, but it's got to be a better chance than the last few weeks.

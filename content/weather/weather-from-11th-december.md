Monday at first glance looks ok - at ground level winds anyway, but lapse charts show a massive rise in wind speeds from a low level, so not so great after all.  There is a chance that HG's may be able to fly the Mynd especially later this afternoon as the wind is due to reduce late on.

Weekend looks possible as the high pressure builds but could give rise to mist and low cloud, but it's got to be a better chance than the last few weeks.

Long run of south westerly winds coming up from Wednesday, but conditions look like slowly deteriorating towards the weekend with wind getting possibly too strong on Saturday and Sunday and the air not as good.  Any of our SW sites could well be ok, though Clatter looks favourite at this moment for direction and strength.

Tuesday might be ok for HG at the Long Mynd, though there is a chance of some rain, WNW and quite breezy. Wednesday looks nice, SW - WSW and moderate winds with good thermal activity, cloudbase up to 4000ft,  will look at site options nearer the time.  Thursday a bit iffy at present, forecasts vary a lot.

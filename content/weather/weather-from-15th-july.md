Tuesday might be ok for HG at the Loing Mynd, though there is a chance of some rain, WNW and quite breezy. Wednesday looks nice, SW - WSW and moderate winds with good thermal activity, cloudbase up to 4000ft,  will look at site options nearer the time.  Thursday a bit iffy at present, forecasts vary a lot.

Wednesday has decent wind but worst direction for Corndon, NE which makes it difficult to ridge soar either the North or East face and it will be too far off to the east for Red Hopton to be soarable.  Next chance for Ridge soaring is Saturday which might be good for Wrekin SE.

\-----------------------------

Tuesday now looks too light to ridge soar Corndon, very thermic and probably turbulent near the hill, varying in direction repeatedly during the day.  Wednesday has more wind.

\----------------------------------------

Next two days Monday and Tuesday look ideal for Corndon, wind speeds look about right for soaring the east face.  Today probably late on after the inversion lifts.  Tuesday might be better for longer and also much more thermic with some chance of cumulus cloud.  Then the wind is due to gradually back during the week round to North and probably quite light but we'll see about that.

Tuesday now looks too light to ridge soar Corndon, very thermic and probably turbulent near the hill, varying in direction repeatedly during the day.  Wednesday has more wind.

\----------------------------------------

Next two days Monday and Tuesday look ideal for Corndon, wind speeds look about right for soaring the east face.  Today probably late on after the inversion lifts.  Tuesday might be better for longer and also much more thermic with some chance of cumulus cloud.  Then the wind is due to gradually back during the week round to North and probably quite light but we'll see about that.

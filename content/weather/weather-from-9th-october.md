Saturday windy but NW to WNW,  probably too much for the Mynd except HG, but could be ok for both at Long Mountain

Sunday lighter winds again NW, looks promising for some nice ridge soaring with maybe a bit of thermal activity.

At present I can't see a good day this week, for a variety of reasons, none look nicely soarable.  Hopefully that will change as the week progresses

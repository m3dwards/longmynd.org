Mynd currently WNW but this morning is due to Veer NW for a while as the speed increases.  Later on due to go back to WNW.  So might get a bit too windy for some PG pilots for a while but otherwise nice air  BBC TV last night said showers likely but other forecasts online say none.

\----------------------------------------------- 

Weekend now even better I think.  Saturday slightly less wind now, certainly ok for HG's on the Mynd and PG's probably ok from Long Mountain, though forecasts vary a little in direction, some giving it more WNW than NW while others show it very definitely NW from lunchtime.  High cloudbase for time of year and nicely thermic, maybe the last XC chance for those into that.   Whether the Long Mynd will be suitable for PG's is borderline wind speeds at present.

Sunday, forecasts vary a lot between North and East so as long as it's one or other, Corndon will be on though it may be rather light to soar reliably.  Not as thermic  as Saturday and likely to be blue and sunny with clouds over the Cambrian mountains.

\------------------------------------

Weekend now changed.  More WNW on Saturday, blown out for PG but good for HG on the Long Mynd.  Sunday currently showing as our worst direction NE but light/moderate speeds at all heights and lapse charts look good, hopefully the direction will change either N or E.

\---------------------------------

Saturday windy but NW to WNW,  probably too much for the Mynd except HG, but could be ok for both at Long Mountain

Sunday lighter winds again NW, looks promising for some nice ridge soaring with maybe a bit of thermal activity.

\------------------------------------------------------------------

At present I can't see a good day this week, for a variety of reasons, none look nicely soarable.  Hopefully that will change as the week progresses

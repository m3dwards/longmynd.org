Forecasts have changed a bit, Friday wind could be in any direction but very light, might be thermic enough in the afternoon from somewhere - check all the weather stations as it will locally vary.

Saturday really light winds too but Sunday looks like being a Corndon ridge soaring day if lucky

\----------------------------------------

Friday has really light winds around here, mostly S to SE - maybe even E but too light to soar but it should be thermic but generally overcast, might be ok at Wrekin SE.

Saturday light to moderate easterly but thermic, so Corndon might be good.

\-----------------------------------------

Tuesday was unlaunchable at the Mynd until nearly 4pm then it got good soaring and briefly nicely thermic but with a low cumulus cloudbase of 2500ft ASL.  The wind had been SW then at 3pm an hour after the rain, it switched well off to the north of NW but then backed WNW and the sky cleared.  Nice to see so many red streamers having proper ridge soaring conditions into the evening.

Wednesday is supposed to be a much nicer day all through, however much more likely to be ideal for HG, I can't make my mind up whether blown out for PG, it's already reasonably breezy and due to get a lot stronger as the thermals mix the air later.  Direction WNW and backing W with cloudbase up to 4500ft.

\-------------------------------------

Tuesday is lighter winds than previously forecast, but as the weak front passes through a bit of drizzle is expected lunchtime or after.  Once the front has passed the wind will quickly veer NW and the sky clear a bit so it might be a bit better around teatime or after.

\----------------------------------

Bank holiday Monday should be flyable with only a slim chance of rain.  Foreacsts vary between ideal and fairly breezy and virtually all forecasts have it as NW and probably a bit far north for Long Mynd to be ideal, though it will launchable for HG's there.  Cloudbse foreacsts vary between 3000 or getting up to maybe 4500ft at best.  Options for PG's which may be better will be the lower launch at the Lawley or Llandinam as some forecasts give the wind a bit less over there.  Long Mountain should also work, but not late on into the evening as the wind is forecast to back more west by then - This evening should give some PG soaring at the Mynd even if it hasn't been good in the day.

Tuesday and Wednesday are much more west but at present to be noticeably windier than Monday so good for HG's at the Mynd, but possibly too much for many PG pilots to choose to fly,  plenty of time for that to change yet!  There's due to be some weak fronts passing through on Tuesday, depending on timings might be poor but it leaves Wednesday as a nice post cold frontal cool westerly airflow so hopefully good thermalling.

Thursday is due to be frontal and then into Friday and the weekend there is some hope of it getting quite good.

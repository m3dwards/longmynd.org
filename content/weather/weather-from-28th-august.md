Tuesday is lighter winds than previously forecast, but as the weak front passes through a bit of drizzle is expected lunchtime or after.  Once the front has passed the wind will quickly veer NW and the sky clear a bit so it might be a bit better around teatime or after.

\----------------------------------

Bank holiday Monday should be flyable with only a slim chance of rain.  Foreacsts vary between ideal and fairly breezy and virtually all forecasts have it as NW and probably a bit far north for Long Mynd to be ideal, though it will launchable for HG's there.  Cloudbse foreacsts vary between 3000 or getting up to maybe 4500ft at best.  Options for PG's which may be better will be the lower launch at the Lawley or Llandinam as some forecasts give the wind a bit less over there.  Long Mountain should also work, but not late on into the evening as the wind is forecast to back more west by then - This evening should give some PG soaring at the Mynd even if it hasn't been good in the day.

Tuesday and Wednesday are much more west but at present to be noticeably windier than Monday so good for HG's at the Mynd, but possibly too much for many PG pilots to choose to fly,  plenty of time for that to change yet!  There's due to be some weak fronts passing through on Tuesday, depending on timings might be poor but it leaves Wednesday as a nice post cold frontal cool westerly airflow so hopefully good thermalling.

Thursday is due to be frontal and then into Friday and the weekend there is some hope of it getting quite good.

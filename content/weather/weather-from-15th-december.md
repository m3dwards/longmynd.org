Friday sunny but windy - WSW backing SW - probably too much even for HG's, but you never know!

\----------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday looks launchable at the Mynd, forecasts vary a little but somewhere between West and North West and between just enough to ground handle to just about soarable.  Cloudy though with a lot of mid-level stuff, marginally improving as the front moves further away.

I think I was mostly right about yesterday, the HG's did fly but very late on when it calmed a bit, having watched the video with the gliders rigged but not going anywhere most of the day.

Thursday still looking like a good soaring and thermalling day for all.  Could be a bit windy, direction seems settled on NW direction (Lawley, Wrekin, Clunbury, Lan Fawr, Little London), so any of our sites unless it's windy when it would have to be long mountain.

\----------------------------------

All hopes at present lie with Thursday, wet and or windy until then, then afterwards likewise, though some forecasts have it good from Thursday onwards.

Ah, forgot all about HG's for today as thought it to be too windy for them, but there's plenty rigging to fly the Mynd.

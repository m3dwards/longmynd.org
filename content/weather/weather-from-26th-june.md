Sunday just might be ok, SW winds and fairly brisk but less than Saturday.  Won't be able to do any more weather watching until end of next week from me.

\---------------------------------------------------

Thursday by many forecasts has a short band of rain passing through mid - late morning. as that passes the wind backs more WNW than NW around here, but fairly brisk after a quiet low wind time with the rain.  After that excellent thermic conditions.  whether it will be too windy for the Mynd PG launching I'm not sure, but it does look on the top end side of windy, but should be ok for HG's

\----------------------------

I think I was mostly right about yesterday, the HG's did fly but very late on when it calmed a bit, having watched the video with the gliders rigged but not going anywhere most of the day.

Thursday still looking like a good soaring and thermalling day for all.  Could be a bit windy, direction seems settled on NW direction (Lawley, Wrekin, Clunbury, Lan Fawr, Little London), so any of our sites unless it's windy when it would have to be long mountain.

\----------------------------------

All hopes at present lie with Thursday, wet and or windy until then, then afterwards likewise, though some forecasts have it good from Thursday onwards.

Ah, forgot all about HG's for today as thought it to be too windy for them, but there's plenty rigging to fly the Mynd.

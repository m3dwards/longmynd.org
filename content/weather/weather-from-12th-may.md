Thursday has quite high upper winds but much lower near surface, so weather stations are showing quite light winds.  The North Wales area is due to have varying wind directions, but at Corndon it is due to be NNE, so Corndon may be ok.  Red Hopton too as long as there is a lot of north in it.

\----------------

Wednesday afternoon late on looks possible for Corndon, too windy to start with though, evening has winds reducing and the inversion nice and high.

Gets windier again so rest of the week and weekend looking iffy.

\----------------------

Monday & Tuesday look like breezy but might be flyable at Corndon, but there is a risk of massive development and possibly thunderstorms.  Wednesday onwards is looking promising though with generally a bit light winds and strongly thermic but dry conditions.  For low airtimers and those not experienced or comfortable with potentially strong/radicle conditions then late afternoon or evening likely to give more enjoyable conditions, especially as at this time of year it can be soarable until late evening.  Wind forecasts vary a bit but seems to be going from East to North then back again during the week from Wednesday onwards.

Monday & Tuesday look like breezy but might be flyable at Corndon, but there is a risk of massive development and possibly thunderstorms.  Wednesday onwards is looking promising though with generally a bit light winds and strongly thermic but dry conditions.  For low airtimers and those not experienced or comfortable with potentially strong/radicle conditions then late afternoon or evening likely to give more enjoyable conditions, especially as at this time of year it can be soarable until late evening.  Wind forecasts vary a bit but seems to be going from East to North then back again during the week from Wednesday onwards.

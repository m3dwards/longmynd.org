Rubbish all week by the look of things with a glint of hope for the weekend.  Looks like the start of those long depressing winter weeks that go on for ever, where we forlornly watch the weather for a brief chance of aviation.

On a positive note, when it's good it can be really fun in the winter, so do get out if you can as it makes a difference when it comes to the spring.

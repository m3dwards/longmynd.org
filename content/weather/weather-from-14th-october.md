Big change - Saturday looks on for the Long Mynd - somewhere between W and NW and soarable speeds for PG and HG.  Cloudbase not massive 2500 to 3000ft maybe, but also some weak thermals to take you there.

Foggy Friday and hideous weekend coming up.

Today I think is now going to be too windy, as well as everywhere being seriously wet.

\-----------------------------------------------

Thursday might be on, SW winds and quite brisk in Wales though.  Worth watching out for I think.

\---------------------------

Rubbish all week by the look of things with a glint of hope for the weekend.  Looks like the start of those long depressing winter weeks that go on for ever, where we forlornly watch the weather for a brief chance of aviation.

On a positive note, when it's good it can be really fun in the winter, so do get out if you can as it makes a difference when it comes to the spring.

Well, quick glance at ground level weather suggests Friday/Saturday ok.  However looking in more detail, a very strong wind gradient and forecasts vary with cloud from ground level up to maybe 2,000ft.  So this far away, worth watching but don't get your hopes up too much.

Tuesday nice once/if the mist clears but no wind.

Friday nice weather but most likely too light to ridge soar - anywhere between N and E direction with a noticeable inversion probably around or just above ridge height.  Saturday worse with thick cloud from a low height, possibly SW direction and Sunday is even worse.

\----------------------------------------------

Well, quick glance at ground level weather suggests Friday/Saturday ok.  However looking in more detail, a very strong wind gradient and forecasts vary with cloud from ground level up to maybe 2,000ft.  So this far away, worth watching but don't get your hopes up too much.

Tuesday nice once/if the mist clears but no wind.

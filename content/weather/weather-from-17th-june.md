Wow, an actual run of decent weather forecast, though not ideal for weekend only pilots.

Today westerly and probably mostly HG speeds though there is the chance of some rain in the middle of the day.

Tuesday lighter winds and going North so it depends just on exactly how the change in direction is going to determine possible launch sites.

Wednesday more likely East so Corndon

Thursday currently SW so our Welsh sites

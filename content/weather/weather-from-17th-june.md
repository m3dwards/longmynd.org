Sunday has much lighter winds than yesterday, with the direction varying between W and WSW/SW.  Probably going to be a lot of local variations in wind speed and direction.  Thermic but with a low cloudbase, maybe getting to 3000ft.  Probably soarable at the Long Mynd but maybe only sporadically.  Our sites further west may have more wind but unsure if the direction will be suitable,  Shepherds Tump does have a bowl that takes WSW and so does Camlo but that part of Camlo is very shallow slope.  Clatter does not tend to work unless it's pretty well SW fully.

\-----------------

Forecast windspeeds now looking a lot higher, so the Mynd may well be considered a bit too windy for some PG's today.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday is looking great for Long Mynd, maybe even other NW sites like Lawley or Wrekin, as there's a bit of a wriggle in wind directions so may at times be more NW than WNW.  Looks good for ridge soaring as well as thermic.

Sunday at present looks far too little wind to ridge soar anywhere, with directions variable but more likely from the south and an inversion at maybe 2500-3000ft.

\------------------------------------------

Thursday is forecast to be very thermic but also very light winds roughly from the south, so unlikely to be ridge soarable at Corndon or Wrekin.

Friday much windier from SW and possibly too much for PG's on our Shepherds Tump or Clatter sites - Clatter is better if windy as not such a sharp lip to launch from which can often make the Tump difficult to actually launch a PG.

Weekend looks promising for ridge soaring from the Long Mynd possibly both days.

\------------------------------

Tuesday sees winds veering from NW to N during the day.  Nice weather but cloudy and should be soarable.  It might be a bit light at Long mountain, so early on Lawley, Clunbury or Wrekin might be better, but when it goes fully north then Corndon likely to be better for soaring.  Interestingly the lapse chart for Newtown gives very variable winds especially low down, but not shown on other forecasts.

Wednesday and Thursday now look like being light wind days around here so may not be ridge soarable.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow, an actual run of decent weather forecast, though not ideal for weekend only pilots.

Today westerly and probably mostly HG speeds though there is the chance of some rain in the middle of the day.

Tuesday lighter winds and going North so it depends just on exactly how the change in direction is going to determine possible launch sites.

Wednesday more likely East so Corndon

Thursday currently SW so our Welsh sites

Tuesday sees winds veering from NW to N during the day.  Nice weather but cloudy and should be soarable.  It might be a bit light at Long mountain, so early on Lawley, Clunbury or Wrekin might be better, but when it goes fully north then Corndon likely to be better for soaring.  Interestingly the lapse chart for Newtown gives very variable winds especially low down, but not shown on other forecasts.

Wednesday and Thursday now look like being light wind days around here so may not be ridge soarable.

Wow, an actual run of decent weather forecast, though not ideal for weekend only pilots.

Today westerly and probably mostly HG speeds though there is the chance of some rain in the middle of the day.

Tuesday lighter winds and going North so it depends just on exactly how the change in direction is going to determine possible launch sites.

Wednesday more likely East so Corndon

Thursday currently SW so our Welsh sites

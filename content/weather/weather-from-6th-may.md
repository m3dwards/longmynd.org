Sunday looking great for the Long Mynd, W possibly just a bit WSW at times, moderate speeds and cloudbase rising to 5000ft in the afternoon.  Will be strongly thermic so maybe not ideal for low airtimers, but better late afternoon, early evening for those pilots.  Alternatively Camlo possibly in even better air.

\-----------------------------

Froday may well be flyable from Clatter or Shepherds Tump, but sometimes very windy and gusty and showery.  Sunday might be flyable too.

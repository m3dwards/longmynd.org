Monday has a strong likelihood of some heavy showers.  The unstable air is forecast to produce towering Cu to 30,000ft, possibly embedded - so you can't see them.  Winds are due to change but generally from NW to NE direction and varying with height,  For any flying I would suggest it may be ok and safe, but only if you are under a relatively clear sky and as clouds build, they could grow very fast, so get down quick.

The rest of the week looks favourable for flying, not epic XC conditions but might give some nice soaring conditions with any luck.

Tuesday northerly

Wednesday southerly

Thursday west

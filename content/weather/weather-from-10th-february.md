Slight chance on Sunday for Corndon, at present too much east in it for Wrekin.  Inversion due to be above the top.  right sort of speed and supposedly dry.

\--------------------------------------------

Today (Thursday) looks on for Corndon, with the murk lifting this afternoon to well above the top, quite breezy but should be soarable.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Improves during the week, but with a low inversion forecast on every day, conditions for decent flying look poor.  Last week peo0ple reports difficult conditions with turbulence at the inversion layer, level or below launch heights, so may well be similar this week.  But, thinking positively the weekend is a long way off so could well change by then.

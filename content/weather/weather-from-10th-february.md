Improves during the week, but with a low inversion forecast on every day, conditions for decent flying look poor.  Last week peo0ple reports difficult conditions with turbulence at the inversion layer, level or below launch heights, so may well be similar this week.  But, thinking positively the weekend is a long way off so could well change by then.

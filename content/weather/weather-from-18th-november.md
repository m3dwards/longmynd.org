Wednesday, Today has moderate winds but the lapse charts so a very big variation in direction with height - WSW to W at ground level but N or NNE at altitude above hills, so could be shear turbulence present.  To avoid the struggle to get up the Mynd which might not be a a suitable site anyway, try Black Knoll or one of our NW sites which have less of an ice access issue than the Mynd will have over the next few days.                                             

Thursday looks a more moderate and reliable wind direction, Friday blown out.

\------------------------------------

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at this moment looking promising for Hang Gliding and possibly PG, but likely top end or blown out. Wind direction somewhere between W and N. The air is due to be cold unstable airmass so thermals may even be lurking around at this time of the year!

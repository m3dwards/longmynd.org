I was wrong about it being windy on Wednesday, sadly as I went to virtually the only place that didn't have any wind.  Thursday is due to be ENE-E and lighter around here than elsewhere and Corndon likes a decent bit of wind, but it might be ok, though much lighter than yesterdays forecast for around here.  Low inversion so just above Corndon might be above inversion so could be better.

\---------------------------------------

Still as before, wind at mynd veering to wnw, but expected to be HG rather than PG speeds most of the day.

\---------------------------------------

Wednesday a Mynd day but could be top end for PG's, better for HG.  right direction with high cloud clearing in the afternoon to allo more sunshine and a better chance of thermals.  An alternative may be Llandinam where the wind is forecast to be less, though the hill is much bigger.  Maybe Camlo as well and that is much smaller.

\---------------------------------------------------

Monday sees it improving from the current clag, but quite windy, maybe ok for HG at Clatter.

Wednesday due to be a good post cold frontal day with good thermic activity (for the time of the year), west veering NW.  Forecasts vary in wind strength from being ideal soaring for PG's to top end, good for HG.

Thursday and Friday has high pressure over the area with easterly winds but inverted at a low level so no thermals and possibly low cloud, though that could well change a lot depending on where the high is centred.

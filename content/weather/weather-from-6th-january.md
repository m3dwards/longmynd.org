Forecasts are still vary wayward.  Some say today (Tuesday) blown out but others suggest might be ok for HG on the Mynd if it's accessible.  Wednesday either no wind or soarable just about on NE corner of  Corndon.  Thursday is west and might be ok for PG and HG on the Mynd, but could be too much for PG.

Forecasts are varying wildly between them at present, so low confidence, but maybe Thursday / Friday being soarable for PG and HG.  Tuesday probably blown out on the Mynd even for HG.

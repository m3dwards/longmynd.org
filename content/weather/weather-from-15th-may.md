Monday looks blown out,  there is maybe just a slim chance of Long Mountain, for HG to fly there but I think quite probably still blown out for PG.

Tuesday, sort of similar fresh post frontal and thermic and turbulent air but a bit calmer than Monday, so could be ok.  At this moment it still looks like it would have to be Long Mountain though due to wind speed.

Wednesday again good air but much lighter winds - though so far the forecasts for direction have been changing all over, and it may be too light for ridge soaring.

Tuesday was flyable early on in the morning at Long Mountain, but only just then, with some very long XC's achieved.  It was also basically blown out for much of the day from lunchtime onwards.  Pity there were no HG's there as would have been ideal for them as the Modellers showed the way.

Wednesday forecasts have changed and is much lighter and tending to be more north.  better for ridge soaring for more people I think.  Wrekin, Lawley, Clunbury all look possible and maybe if it goes north enough Cormdon, but some forecasts suggest it may well be too light to ridge soar anywhere at times, other say it's ideal.  Other than that possibly a lot of cloud even the odd patch of rain but also pretty thermic.

Thusday really light winds

\==========================================================

Monday looks blown out,  there is maybe just a slim chance of Long Mountain, for HG to fly there but I think quite probably still blown out for PG.

Tuesday, sort of similar fresh post frontal and thermic and turbulent air but a bit calmer than Monday, so could be ok.  At this moment it still looks like it would have to be Long Mountain though due to wind speed.

Wednesday again good air but much lighter winds - though so far the forecasts for direction have been changing all over, and it may be too light for ridge soaring.

Thursday now looks great for ridge and thermalling.  SW backing S during the day with moderate wind speeds.  early on Clatter or Shepherds Tump, with later on if it goes fully S then Camlo or even maybe Wrekin SE side probably not great for S side of Corndon though.

Then windy again until Sunday.

\--------------------------------------------

At present the only day not too windy is Tuesday, but only because it's raining.  Good job it's Easter holiday coming up with no one wanting to fly.

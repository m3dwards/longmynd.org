Sunday has moderate falling light winds, starting off east but veering SE. the current low cloud will lift to be a blue day and I think that as the inversion lifts the winds will reduce on the hill.  a low inversion over a hill produces a venturi affect increasing the wind speed but usually also making the wind more horizontal, but for ridge soaring maybe a better chance earlier than later.  The inversion is due to rise at Corndon to 4000ft and be thermic.

\----------------------------------

Yesterdays suggestions I think are still spot on for today (Thursday).  For low airtime pilots please be very aware of the chance of very sharp edged spring thermals.  later on in the afternoon may well be better.

\------------------------

Thursday now looks great for ridge and thermalling.  SW backing S during the day with moderate wind speeds.  early on Clatter or Shepherds Tump, with later on if it goes fully S then Camlo or even maybe Wrekin SE side probably not great for S side of Corndon though.

Then windy again until Sunday.

\--------------------------------------------

At present the only day not too windy is Tuesday, but only because it's raining.  Good job it's Easter holiday coming up with no one wanting to fly.

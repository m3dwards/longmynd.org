Saturday is due to be SE winds but may be too strong especially from middle of the day for Wrekin.  Corndon can cope with a lot more wind and in fact usually needs it, but the direction is less than ideal, however was soarable recently when the wind was pretty well SE (from looking at people tracklogs), so might be ok.  Likely to be a breakdown of conditions later in the afternoon.

Sunday has changing winds during the day with the possibility of Cunims and or rain in the afternoon, so could be flyable somewhere, but just depends on the day how it turns out.  Possibly a bit windier than Saturday. 

\---------------------------------------------------

I didn't post for Monday, partly because I forgot and mostly because I thought it too light for ridge soaring Corndon - so for those that went, what was it like?

Tuesday is supposed to be dry and easterly until late afternoon, but it's already raining a fair bit where I am so might arrive Corndon sooner than anticipated.

Next chance is Thursday and into Friday and Saturday, which are looking positive at this moment, so will update nearer then.

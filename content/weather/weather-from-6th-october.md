Well, RASP was totally wrong for Wednesday with some nice afternoon flying visible on webcams and Puretrack at the Mynd.  Today is more of a Hang Gliding day at the Mynd with westerly moderate to fresh winds.  Probably ok for PG's too but not as nice clear air as yesterdays post-frontal.   Friday could also be on but much lighter winds from the west so may only be scratchy soarable - not sure yet.

\---------------------

Wednesday still has RASP at odds with other forecasts, but at this moment I think more likely to be right seeing as it's clagged in and north.  The other forecasts have it as a nice NW to WNW wind with cloudbase 2500ft or so.

\----------------

Tuesday still windy - maybe ok for HG - wind WSW.

Wednesday, RASP is still at complete odds with other forecasts - the rest say on and PG flyable at the Mynd, Rasp says virtually nothing and North.

Thursday and Friday look on at the Mynd or NW sites but could be on windy side for some PG's and also some likelyhood of being clagged in or very low cloudbase at or near hill top.

\-----------------------------------------------------

Some ridge soaring possible this week.  HG today at the Long Mynd, maybe Tuesday also, then lighter and more chance of being NW direction Wednesday and Thursday.  I'll have a look on the day to suggest suitable sites.  Not sure about the weekend at this stage as wind could be from anywhere.

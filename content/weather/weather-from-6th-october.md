Tuesday still windy - maybe ok for HG - wind WSW.

Wednesday, RASP is still at complete odds with other forecasts - the rest say on and PG flyable at the Mynd, Rasp says virtually nothing and North.

Thursday and Friday look on at the Mynd or NW sites but could be on windy side for some PG's

\-----------------------------------------------------

Some ridge soaring possible this week.  HG today at the Long Mynd, maybe Tuesday also, then lighter and more chance of being NW direction Wednesday and Thursday.  I'll have a look on the day to suggest suitable sites.  Not sure about the weekend at this stage as wind could be from anywhere.

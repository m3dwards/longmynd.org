Monday sees a lot of pre-frontal cloud, though it looks like there might be the odd break in that.  Winds moderate and from West to NW direction.  Looks like being a good ridge soaring day, either Mynd or Lawley, maybe Llandinam if not too far W in direction over there.

Wednesday and Thursday yet to be confirmed as might be too windy for PG here.

Thursday looks windy again, but much better than yesterday with a bit more of a chance of PG's flying.  Good for HG's.  Decent cloudbase but there is a greater chance of some showers passing through.  Predominantly westerly which for PG's is a shame as if more NW then Long Mountain is far better on windy days for soaring.

Friday and weekend not looking great for PG's.

\----------------------------------------------

Wednesday looks like being a lovely day at the Mynd for HG, apart from the chance of showers coming along occasionally.  Probably too windy for PG's, though the wind does ease in the evening.  Thursday still breezy but is due to be noticeably less windy than today so a better chance for both HG and PG at the Long Mynd.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Monday sees a lot of pre-frontal cloud, though it looks like there might be the odd break in that.  Winds moderate and from West to NW direction.  Looks like being a good ridge soaring day, either Mynd or Lawley, maybe Llandinam if not too far W in direction over there.

Wednesday and Thursday yet to be confirmed as might be too windy for PG here.

It was too windy and gusty yesterday,  today is due to be a bit less and nicer air in the NW of our area, but wind direction awkward as not at all ideal for Clatter.  Llandinam isn't great in a WSW but it might be useable.  Camlo isn't in the best air by RASP, but it is launchable and soarable in that direction.  Mynd might work too much later on.

\--------------------------------



Monday looks nice air, but a bit windy and gusty.  I think most likely blown out for PG's, but there is a chance that Clatter might be ok for HG's this afternoon.

Tuesday lighter winds but air not as good with poor lapse charts.  After that the forecasts are all over the place, but just maybe the better light wind forecasts come good around Thursday.

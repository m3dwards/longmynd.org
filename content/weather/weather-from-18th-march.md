Monday looks nice air, but a bit windy and gusty.  I think most likely blown out for PG's, but there is a chance that Clatter might be ok for HG's this afternoon.

Tuesday lighter winds but air not as good with poor lapse charts.  After that the forecasts are all over the place, but just maybe the better light wind forecasts come good around Thursday.

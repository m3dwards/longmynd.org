Tuesday (Boxing Day) looks a possibility.  Starting off west and soarable speeds at the Long Mynd, but by current forecasts due to back to the South fairly quickly and reduce in speed, so it all depends exactly when it goes off and if our SW sites may be any good or too light.  Cloudbase above the hill tops.  Rest of the week back to wet and windy.

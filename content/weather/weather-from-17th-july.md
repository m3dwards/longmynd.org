Friday now quite windy so ok for HG's at the Long Mynd but pretty well going to be blown out for PG's by the time the air gets more  active.  The less we say about the weekend the better!

\------------------------------------

Thursday has a variation amongst forecasts - hardly any wind from west going NNW to N and towering Cu with rain, or moderate west in the morning with some chance of rain this afternoon.  

Friday looks like a Mynd day but might become blown out for some PG's.

\-------------------------------------------------

Rain this morning (Wednesday) very likely and a bit blowy, but drying up in the afternoon and getting slightly less wind so looks good for the NW sites around here.

\------------------------------

Current thoughts are Long Mountain, Llandinam (Little London), Lawley, having said that some forecasts indicate winds might be west enough for the Mynd.  CANP raised for Lawley so far - 'Your NOTAMID is H4501/23' for 19th all day.  And yes there are still likely to be showers with clouds developing from 3500ft up to about 9000.

\----------------------

Wednesday looks good so far,  Not totally sure of site yet as it might be on the Mynd but might be better on our NW sites.  Still some chance of showers but a lot less than recently.  Wind strength between ideal and top end for PG's

\------------------------------------------------

Generally looking a lot more positive this week than the last few.

Monday showery but W to WSW and fairly breezy but ok for HG at the Mynd and cloudbase below 4000ft but with some towering cu, gradually lessening as the day goes on

Tuesday still showery with towering Cu but SW or even S wind and a lower cloudbase with a lot of mid level cloud.

Wednesday NW to NNW moderate speeds and now due to be dry and thermic, this might change as until this morning it was supposed to be poor thermically.  Ok speeds for PG

Rest of the week quite positive for some soaring and thermalling

Generally looking a lot more positive this week than the last few.

Monday showery but W to WSW and fairly breezy but ok for HG at the Mynd and cloudbase below 4000ft but with some towering cu, gradually lessening as the day goes on

Tuesday still showery with towering Cu but SW or even S wind and a lower cloudbase with a lot of mid level cloud.

Wednesday NW to NNW moderate speeds and now due to be dry and thermic, this might change as until this morning it was supposed to be poor thermically.  Ok speeds for PG

Rest of the week quite positive for some soaring and thermalling

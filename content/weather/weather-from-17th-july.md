Current thoughts are Long Mountain, Llandinam (Little London), Lawley, having said that some forecasts indicate winds might be west enough for the Mynd.  CANP raised for Lawley so far - 'Your NOTAMID is H4501/23' for 19th all day.  And yes there are still likely to be showers with clouds developing from 3500ft up to about 9000.

\----------------------

Wednesday looks good so far,  Not totally sure of site yet as it might be on the Mynd but might be better on our NW sites.  Still some chance of showers but a lot less than recently.  Wind strength between ideal and top end for PG's

\------------------------------------------------

Generally looking a lot more positive this week than the last few.

Monday showery but W to WSW and fairly breezy but ok for HG at the Mynd and cloudbase below 4000ft but with some towering cu, gradually lessening as the day goes on

Tuesday still showery with towering Cu but SW or even S wind and a lower cloudbase with a lot of mid level cloud.

Wednesday NW to NNW moderate speeds and now due to be dry and thermic, this might change as until this morning it was supposed to be poor thermically.  Ok speeds for PG

Rest of the week quite positive for some soaring and thermalling

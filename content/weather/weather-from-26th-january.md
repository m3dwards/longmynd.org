Wednesday looks a probable - SE backing E during the day, stronger further east so Wrekin might be top end and Corndon might be too light , but supposed to be dry (in the air, ground is going to be a bog) with a decent temperature rise during the day raising the cloud away from the hills.

After that, back to awful again for another week.

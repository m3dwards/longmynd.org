Saturday and Sunday both have good conditions in the late afternoon and right into the evening for soaring Corndon.  Earlier in the day is likely to be inverted at a low-ish level causing turbulence, a venturi effect on the hill increasing the wind speed but reducing the lift, so later is almost certainly much better.

\--------------------------------------



Update thursday - some forecasts have it on the Mynd later this afternoon/evening.

Light winds for the next few days so little chance of ridge soaring, however the sea breeze could possibly get as far as Llandinam so could come on west there - the Clatter weather station will show it.  The Long Mynd in the late afternoon sometimes works after the whole hill area gets hot enough to create a local wind.

\----------------------

Tuesday, forecasts vary a little regarding direction, some say ideal for Long Mynd, others our NW sites.  Wind speed also to some extent might be on the strong side middle of the day, or maybe just right.  Large areas of cloud with spreadout expected in sporadic places, so that will impact wind direction and speed locally.

Wednesday  probably lighter winds maybe not even risge soarable but more likely on at the Mynd.  Thursday no wind.

\------------------------

Quite a promising week for some soaring though thermic and turbulent all week, so late afternoon and evening will be best for low airtimers or those just wanting to ridge soar.

Quite windy Monday, the only decent safe option for PG's will be Long Mountain, and even there might be too much.  

Tuesday lighter winds but could still be on the strong side middle of the day, forecasts vary between WNW and fully NW, so Mynd might be on or any of our other sites - bear in mind Wrekin, Caer Caradoc and Lawley are spine backs if launching when windy.  Note that NW is not generally a great direction for the Mynd as the air in front of the hill is descending and it can often be more turbulent and less lifty on the ridge than when straight on or slightly off to the W or WSW.

Wednesday winds start the progress of backing, and currently forecast to be on at the Long Mynd.

Thursday much harder to predict though soarable speeds at times but location not sure yet

Friday through to Sunday generally due to head towards the SE direction and get much hotter, but will wait to see how that develops.

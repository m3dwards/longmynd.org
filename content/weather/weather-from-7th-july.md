Quite a promising week for some soaring though thermic and turbulent all week, so late afternoon and evening will be best for low airtimers or those just wanting to ridge soar.

Quite windy Monday, the only decent safe option for PG's will be Long Mountain, and even there might be too much.  

Tuesday lighter winds but could still be on the strong side middle of the day, forecasts vary between WNW and fully NW, so Mynd might be on or any of our other sites - bear in mind Wrekin, Caer Caradoc and Lawley are spine backs if launching when windy.  Note that NW is not generally a great direction for the Mynd as the air in front of the hill is descending and it can often be more turbulent and less lifty on the ridge than when straight on or slightly off to the W or WSW.

Wednesday winds start the progress of backing, and currently forecast to be on at the Long Mynd.

Thursday much harder to predict though soarable speeds at times but location not sure yet

Friday through to Sunday generally due to head towards the SE direction and get much hotter, but will wait to see how that develops.

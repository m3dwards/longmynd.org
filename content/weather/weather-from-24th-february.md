Tuesday looks like being a Mynd day for hang gliding,  sunny but with some fairly big clouds but dry.

Friday/Saturday looking more likely for PG on the Mynd.  Thursday just might be ok for Long Mountain due to the wind speed.

\--------------------------------------------------

Fingers crossed we might actually get some proper weather (proper for our game) later this week.  Forecasts vary a bit as might be too windy on Wednesday with a front nearby but Thursday/Friday looking possible at this moment.

Will be watching forecasts closely and update as and when.

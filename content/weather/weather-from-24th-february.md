Tuesday looks like being a Mynd day for hang gliding,  sunny but with some fairly big clouds but dry.  Not as strong at present as forecast, but could be wave influenced, just maybe some periods suitable for PG's but not if the forecasts are trusted.

Friday/Saturday looking more likely for PG on the Mynd.  Thursday just might be ok for Long Mountain due to the wind speed.

\--------------------------------------------------

Fingers crossed we might actually get some proper weather (proper for our game) later this week.  Forecasts vary a bit as might be too windy on Wednesday with a front nearby but Thursday/Friday looking possible at this moment.

Will be watching forecasts closely and update as and when.

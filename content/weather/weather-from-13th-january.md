Friday has a chance it stays clear in the west and might be ok on Clatter - could be top end for some PG's a it is at this moment, right direction though.  Sunday by some forecasts might be on the Mynd and light, but others say completely south.

\-------------------------------------------------

Wrekin is on the north edge of forecast fog, but might be in bright sunshine, if so the SE side might be soarable today Thursday.

\---------------------------------------

Wednesday may well be on at the Mynd, ground level winds due to be very low and SW but rapidly rising in temperature and speed above ground level and veering West.  From 2000ft the wind speeds are forecast to be lower again.  There could be a chance especially early on that the valley fog blows up the hill.

\---------------------------------------

Interesting to note that ground level forecasts are very low, below soarable speeds, yet due to the massive ground affect with current weather and low cloudbase creating a venturi over the hills , it is far too windy - Gusting 48mph on Lawley.

\------------------------------

Quite possibly flyable during the week, but so difficult to predict due to the expected mist and low level inversions which will create very localised conditions, clear or otherwise.  Wind direction generally SW or S.

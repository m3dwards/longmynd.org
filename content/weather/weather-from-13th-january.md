Interesting to note that ground level forecasts are very low, below soarable speeds, yet due to the massive ground affect with current weather and low cloudbase creating a venturi over the hills , it is far too windy - Gusting 48mph on Lawley.

\------------------------------

Quite possibly flyable during the week, but so difficult to predict due to the expected mist and low level inversions which will create very localised conditions, clear or otherwise.  Wind direction generally SW or S.

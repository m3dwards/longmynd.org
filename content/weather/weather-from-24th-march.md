Today (Friday) looks like ok for HG's, could even be a bit too windy, but ideal direction and post frontal clear air.

Saturday looks a much better bet, but less than ideal direction for the Mynd, being off to the south a bit, but could still be soarable for both HG and PG.  Very thermic.  Not sure about Sunday as might be going windy again.

Saturday and Sunday - forecasts vary between very thermic and HG only speeds to being ok for PG.  For low airtime pilots caution is warranted in the middle of the day due to thermic turbulence.  Somewhere between our SW sites and the Mynd for launching.

\-------------------

Wednesday, there are already red kites soaring Mynd, it is due to go properly west much later and be a PG and HG soarable speed from afternoon up to dusk

\--------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday has wind veering from West to N but reasonable speed and should be clear of cloud on hills, but quite cloudy generally.  Eitther Mynd or our NW sites, or all of them during the day at some times.

Wednesday more WSW slightly lower winds and sunny, maybe Mynd or Camlo.

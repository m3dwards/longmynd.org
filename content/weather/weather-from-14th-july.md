Friday looks quite likely on at the Long Mynd later this afternoon - as the wind is due to veer more west.  Looks about the right speed for ridge soaring.

\--------------------------

Wednesday is promising to be soarable on the Mynd and very thermic.  LLandinam might be an alternative.  Later in the week possible too.

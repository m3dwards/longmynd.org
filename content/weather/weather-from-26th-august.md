Windy until the weekend.  Wednesday is best in the far west so could be good for HG at Clatter.  Mynd on Wednesday but looks too strong for PG's at present, except very early in the day when conditions are usually poor for soaring anyway.  From then on the winds are due to reduce and veer all the way round to SE, but timings are not yet precise.

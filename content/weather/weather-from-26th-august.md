Thursday by most forecasts is fairly brisk wind from WSW, probably HG speeds and very thermic.  Might be  ok for some PG's on the mynd but not all day and not for everyones comfort level.

 It is due to be light NE tomorrow which isn't ideal but maybe ok for thermalling from Corndon

\-----------------------

Wednesday has a fading front over us.  Might be ok at Camlo or Shepherds tump later and just maybe the Mynd very late on before dark as the wind veers to the west.  Thursday is Mynd direction but forecasts vary, the ones I usually rely on for ground wind speed indicate it being windy and HG rather than PG speeds, but others say a bit lower and suitable for PG most of the day.

Friday could be anything then the weekend is Corndon, probably soarable.

\-----------------------------

Windy until the weekend.  Wednesday is best in the far west so could be good for HG at Clatter.  Mynd on Wednesday but looks too strong for PG's at present, except very early in the day when conditions are usually poor for soaring anyway.  From then on the winds are due to reduce and veer all the way round to SE, but timings are not yet precise.

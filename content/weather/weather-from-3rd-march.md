Weather gradually gets worse during the week, though forecasts vary a bit.  Today and tomorrow look possibly soarable at the Mynd, Camlo, maybe Shepherds Tump with winds due to be between W - WSW.  Winds back to South or SSE during the week with speeds increasing and the inversion getting lower until a breakdown at the end of the week.

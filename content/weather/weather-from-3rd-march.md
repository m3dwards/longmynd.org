Tuesday now looks much less like Long Mynd and better chance at Clatter or maybe Shepherds Tump, though that can be difficult to launch PG's when windy as such a sharp lip on the SW - SSW face.  Could get a bit windy too but ok for HG.

Similar-ish on Wedneday, and both days are forecast to have quite a low inversion but well above the hill.

\-------------------------------------------

Weather gradually gets worse during the week, though forecasts vary a bit.  Today and tomorrow look possibly soarable at the Mynd, Camlo, maybe Shepherds Tump with winds due to be between W - WSW.  Winds back to South or SSE during the week with speeds increasing and the inversion getting lower until a breakdown at the end of the week.

Wednesday looks likely blown out, just maybe for a while it could be launchable on Long Mountain.

Thursday has forecasts varying from virtually no wind to light but soarable anywhere between NW, N or NE.

Friday looks more promising for the long mynd for HG and PG.

\--------------------------------------------------

Tuesday looks ok this afternoon on the Mynd but could be top end speed for PG's ok for HG though.  Quite thermic after the front has passed through.

Wednesday appears to be slightly less wind but could be more NW direction so our other sites may be better..

\---------------------------------- 

The main thing about this coming week which will be appreciated by many ridge soaring pilots is that it is due to be largely westerly and decent strength - if at times too much for paragliders.

There is likely to be rain at times, but in between could be some nice ridge soaring.  Monday morning at this moment looks possible with Wednesday looking dry and good speed wind.  However, forecasts don't all agree on much this and some are quite pessimistic with a lot of rain and strong winds most of the time.

As expected rather on the windy side Saturday and Sunday, ok for HG though on the long Mynd.  Too much west in it for Long Mountain.  just a thought, maybe Little London might be ok to soar as it is lower than Llandinam and in an area tat is forecast to be marginally less wind.

\-----------------

Thursday much better air in west and Wales but lower winds than further east.  Mostly around North direction but will vary a bit.  Too light for Long Mountain but our sites look ok.  as long as it's west of North, then Wrekin if not too windy, Lawley, Clunbury, Lanfawr.  Too light wind for Red Hopton. Corndon as long as North or east of north

Friday still possible for Mynd but might be off to the south for easy soaring.  Saturday could be a bit windy.

\---------------------------

Wednesday looks likely blown out, just maybe for a while it could be launchable on Long Mountain.

Thursday has forecasts varying from virtually no wind to light but soarable anywhere between NW, N or NE.

Friday looks more promising for the long mynd for HG and PG.

\--------------------------------------------------

Tuesday looks ok this afternoon on the Mynd but could be top end speed for PG's ok for HG though.  Quite thermic after the front has passed through.

Wednesday appears to be slightly less wind but could be more NW direction so our other sites may be better..

\---------------------------------- 

The main thing about this coming week which will be appreciated by many ridge soaring pilots is that it is due to be largely westerly and decent strength - if at times too much for paragliders.

There is likely to be rain at times, but in between could be some nice ridge soaring.  Monday morning at this moment looks possible with Wednesday looking dry and good speed wind.  However, forecasts don't all agree on much this and some are quite pessimistic with a lot of rain and strong winds most of the time.

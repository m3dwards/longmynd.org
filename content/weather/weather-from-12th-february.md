W to WSW today but probably low cloud and top end wind speed even for HG.

\------------------------------------

Monday looks ok if not a bit on the high side for HG at the Mynd, though may be a long way off to the SW, nice air with good cloudbase and some thermic activity, a small risk of showers.

Rest of the week rained off and too windy for PG.

Weekend just might get better.

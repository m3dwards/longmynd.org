Could be an awkward direction on Sunday, wind speed seems ok for ridge soaring but probably too far off the Long Mynd if it is properly WSW.  Maybe Camlo could work?

\----------------------------------------

Wednesday still hopeful but quite windy and definitely SW for Clatter.

\-------------------

Wednesday might be a possible, certainly for HG and maybe PG,  SW direction so Mynd unlikely to work.  Clatter looks a better bet for both HG and PG. Forecasts had been saying it would be wet but currently looking basically dry with a small risk of rain.

Then windy again until Sunday.

Wednesday still hopeful but quite windy and definitely SW for Clatter.

\-------------------

Wednesday might be a possible, certainly for HG and maybe PG,  SW direction so Mynd unlikely to work.  Clatter looks a better bet for both HG and PG. Forecasts had been saying it would be wet but currently looking basically dry with a small risk of rain.

Then windy again until Sunday.

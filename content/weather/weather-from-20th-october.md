Wednesday seems to have settled down with all forecasts now giving light SW and sunny, getting cloudier as the day progresses before the start of the next storm.  It's a toss up at present between Clatter and Shepherds Tump, but if forecast goes back to yesterdays it it might go too far S or SSE so Camlo.  Whether the wind will be enough for reliable ridge soaring is debatable, but hopefully it will be.

\-------------------------------------------

It's too far away to be anything more than very cautious about this, but Wednesday might be dry enough and right sort of winds to fly - broadly southerly direction.

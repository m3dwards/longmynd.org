Forecast rather uncertain, but Sunday could well be a good HG day at the Long Mynd, with any luck also ok for high wind PG flying.

\---------------------------

Very little wind Monday, nice day for top to bottom flights and ground handling light wind practice on the Long Mynd.  Tuesday is due to be more wind from SW so Clatter may work for ridge soaring, or Shepherds Tump.  After that looks wet or windy for rest of the week and weekend.

A generlly westerly week, but at times too much for PG's to ridge soar.  On the other hand there are very likely to be times when it's good.

At this moment, Monday and Tuesday morning early could be ok - but bear in mind that very often early mornings are often not very nice soaring as the wind is more horizontal being squeezed between cloud or an inversion so despite any wind speed lift frequently not what you might expect.

Wednesday at present looks better

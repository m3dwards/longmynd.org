Thursday has weather clearing at present,  Long Mountain I think looks best as will clear soonest and likes plenty of wind.

Friday blown out 

Saturday looks good, probably long Mynd or maybe earlier in the day our NW sites.

\--------------------

Wednesday is varying between WNW and NW during the day but quite windy.  Mynd will be on at times, but maybe middle of the day Long Mountain for PG's to launch and soar.

Thursday and Friday not looking any good at this moment.

\---------------------------------

Tuesday sees a sudden and dramatic change from light SW and damp to fairly brisk NW wind.  Probably on/off rainy too.

Wednesday westerly and good for HG, but may get too strong for PG's to soar in the afternoon at the Mynd.

\----------------------------------------------

A generally westerly week, but at times too much for PG's to ridge soar.  On the other hand there are very likely to be times when it's good.

At this moment, Monday and Tuesday morning early could be ok - but bear in mind that very often early mornings are often not very nice soaring as the wind is more horizontal being squeezed between cloud or an inversion so despite any wind speed lift frequently not what you might expect.

Wednesday at present looks better

Tuesday sees a sudden and dramatic change from light SW and damp to fairly brisk NW wind.  Probably on/off rainy too.

Wednesday westerly and good for HG, but may get too strong for PG's to soar in the afternoon at the Mynd.

\----------------------------------------------

A generally westerly week, but at times too much for PG's to ridge soar.  On the other hand there are very likely to be times when it's good.

At this moment, Monday and Tuesday morning early could be ok - but bear in mind that very often early mornings are often not very nice soaring as the wind is more horizontal being squeezed between cloud or an inversion so despite any wind speed lift frequently not what you might expect.

Wednesday at present looks better

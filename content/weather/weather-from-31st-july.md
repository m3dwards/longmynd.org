Thursday should be flyable for HG's and just possibly PG.  There is a high chance of some biggish clouds and rain especially around lunchtime and after that it gets progressively drier.  The clouds are due to grow to 10,000 or so and most forecasts indicate thunder but I think it will be bad luck if a site is just where one happens to be as quite isolated.  The wind is due to veer slightly from mostly WNW to NW during the day, so for HG's they will have the choice of either the Mynd or our NW sites or even Long Mountian.  For PG's if it is as windy as forecast and does go NW then later on Long Mountain could be ideal, but it does not work great until the direction is NW at least, NNW is best and is great when it is too windy for other sites to safely launch like Lawley or Wrekin (steep and spine back).

Friday NW and still fairly windy but a lot less chance of rain, so looks reasonable and not as strongly thermic

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

None of the forecasts got today right for around here.  All saying thunderstorms and northerly winds with rain and it's the opposite direction and mostly sunny.

\---------------------------------------------

Tuesday should be a fairly nice day,  HG soarable and thermic at the Mynd, but most likely too windy for PG's or at least most.  However the wind is due to decrease in the evening and back SW which is when it could well be ideal for soaring PG, but not at the Mynd.  It probably won't reduce until it backs SW, so maybe if it isn't launchable at the Mynd, go to Shepherds Tump or Clatter.  Shepherds has the advantage of being able to soar the end of the bowl when it is a bit more west and then on the steepest SW face as the wind changes, whereas clatter does not work until it is properly a SW direction.

\--------------------------------------

Call this a summer?

So this coming week looks blown out and rained off, certainly for PG, but HG's might get a chance on Tuesday and Friday on the Mynd.  Any light wind slots may give a few moments for PG's but it won't be low airtimer or early CP pilots sort of conditions with strong upper winds and potential for difficult launch and landings.

Note that after 4th August I will be unable to post anything for a couple of weeks, happy for Roy or Jon to help out though if they can.

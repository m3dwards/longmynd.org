Call this a summer?

So this coming week looks blown out and rained off, certainly for PG, but HG's might get a chance on Tuesday and Friday on the Mynd.  Any light wind slots may give a few moments for PG's but it won't be low airtimer or early CP pilots sort of conditions with strong upper winds and potential for difficult launch and landings.

Note that after 4th August I will be unable to post anything for a couple of weeks, happy for Roy or Jon to help out though if they can.

Ah,  it's possible that our area might have some decent weather on Tuesday and Wednesday.  However forecasts don't all agree, and Tuesday has changed a lot in the last few hours.  The rest of the week looks blown out.

This might change but at present its due to be SW and thermic in the far west of our area so clatter, Shepherds Tump look possible, but there's a broad line of southerly poor air N/S running up the country around Mynd area.

Wednesday SE winds and may be too strong for PG's on the Wrekin.

Having spent a lot of time looking at lots of forecasts, my ideal place would be Camlo today, but personally I don't have the time available.  However the Mynd looks good.  The wind is due to switch around 12 and veer to come on the hill.  Thermic with base just above 3000ft.  There is due to be a band of 'overdevelopment' running N/S and hopefully east of the Mynd but that is a rather  indefinite position.  There is a tiny chance of isolated showers but bad luck rather than a high risk.  Once WNW it's due to stay mostly that all day.  Wind speeds probably nicely soarable at the Mynd for PG's but some forecasts have it quiet low and scratchy.

Wednesday SE direction and may be too windy, but does look half reasonable at present.

Ah,  it's possible that our area might have some decent weather on Tuesday and Wednesday.  However forecasts don't all agree, and Tuesday has changed a lot in the last few hours.  The rest of the week looks blown out.

This might change but at present its due to be SW and thermic in the far west of our area so clatter, Shepherds Tump look possible, but there's a broad line of southerly poor air N/S running up the country around Mynd area.

Wednesday SE winds and may be too strong for PG's on the Wrekin.

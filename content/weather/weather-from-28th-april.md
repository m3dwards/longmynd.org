Friday looks to be mostly N to NE so Corndon.

Saturday and Sunday, stronger winds, but Corndon may still be ok with winds more northerly, Red Hopton may be soarable too.  At present looks a bit far off N to NE for Wrekin to be ideal on any day.  Very strongly thermic on all days, so later in the afternoon and evening best for ridge soaring.

\-----------------------------------------------

Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday have light to moderate winds S or SE, so Wrekin or Corndon may be ok to soar, with a preference for Wrekin to ridge soar as the S face of Corndon is not great for soaring and SE makes it really difficult.  Much better in the afternoon or early evening as the inversion rises with smoother conditions late in the day.  Likely to become very humid with poor visibility later in the week.

Friday might be ok at Corndon, Saturday looking dry and light winds probably east face of Corndon, Sunday might be the Mynd but rainy.

Some flying was had I could see on the cameras yesterday at the Mynd.

looks wet most of today

\---------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday varies on forecasts - should be on at the Mynd and ok speed, but could be quite rainy though the BBC said last night it should be dry this afternoon.  RASP suggests we are in the best area for miles around until well up north.

Only time will tell

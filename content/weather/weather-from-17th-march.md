Sunday might be a northerly soarable day on Corndon, cloudy but ok speeds.

\-----------------------

Wednesday has the winds veering from ESE to S during the day with upper winds more S.  Heavily inverted until well into the afternoon, so not a day for an early start.  should be flyable at Wrekin or possibly Corndon.

Thursday see slightly stronger winds that might be a bit much for some, but better air and cloudbase well over 2000ft - not just a blue inversion.   At present showing as SE direction. 

\-------------------------------------------------------

Pretty windy until at least Wednesday then it's due to be SE direction and if still windy is not great for soaring Wrekin, being a spine back ridge.  there is hope for some lighter winds as it warms up later in the week though.

Saturday looks possible on the Long Mynd, not great due to inversions but clear and roughly suitable speeds. Sunday blown out

It was nice to see someone flying the Mynd on Christmas day (on the webcams). 

\---------------------------------------

Quick, get to the Mynd this morning before the rain arrives.

Best day of the week looks like Christmas day!

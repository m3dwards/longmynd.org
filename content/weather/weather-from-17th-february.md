Saturday looks ok for HG at the Mynd or Camlo, but looks blown out for PG.  base at least 1000 above Mynd with a fair amount of thin cloud at that height, but sunny periods too.

Can't see much chance except maybe some high speed PG flying or HG.  Just maybe a glimmer of a chance in between the storms at the end of the week.

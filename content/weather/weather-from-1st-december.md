Tuesday and Wednesday both have some forecasts suggesting rain in the afternoon around our SW sites, but others say none until the evening when dark.  Windy however so most likely HG or PG speed wing speeds.  Lapse chart say towering Cu to 20,000 ft possible so if that happens wind direction and speeds will change because of it.

\--------------------------------------

Tuesday and Wednesday look flyable, but more likely for HG as at present looks at least as windy as Sunday just gone on both days.  Mostly dry but there is a forecast of some large towering Cu that could cause rain, but only very localised.  Wind direction both days is wavering between South and South West.  For HG pilots,  last time I was at Clatter a few weeks ago, I could not get the gate padlock open, so it may be a long carry.  Shepherds Tump  takes a bit more SSW than Clatter anyway and is much steeper which does make it difficult for PG's to launch at ST when windy.

Tuesday and Wednesday look flyable, but more likely for HG as at present looks at least as windy as Sunday just gone on both days.  Mostly dry but there is a forecast of some large towering Cu that could cause rain, but only very localised.  Wind direction both days is wavering between South and South West.  For HG pilots,  last time I was at Clatter a few weeks ago, I could not get the gate padlock open, so it may be a long carry.  Shepherds Tump  takes a bit more SSW than Clatter anyway and is much steeper which does make it difficult for PG's to launch at ST when windy.

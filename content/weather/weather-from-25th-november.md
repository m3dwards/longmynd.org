I completely missed Wednesday,  it had been forecast to be wet and windy from the edge of the storm, but ended up being totally nice for those that flew.

Rest of this week looks to be blown out on all 3 days and with a very low cloudbase on Sunday too.

\---------------------

At present Thursday is forecast to have a very low level inversion and then above that be pretty windy, so I think Wrekin will be above the inversion and blown out on launch unfortunately.

\------------------------------------------------------

Thursday just might be possible at Wrekin SE, but the charts indicate that by about 1500 ASL it's going to be blown out, as there is such a strong wind gradient.  Nice and sunny though.

\---------------------------------------------------

Tuesday (today) at present still looks like a Mynd day.  However, forecasts vary just where the lighter wind areas may be.  The wind could remain WSW or come more on the hill, so in effect it might be too light, just right or a bit windy for PG/HG.  An alternative could be Camlo where it is due to be a bit windier if the Mynd becomes too light.  Lapse chart is excellent for November.

\---------------------------------------------

Monday blown out by all views, even for HG I think.

Tuesday looks a nice Mynd day, some forecasts suggest a bit light for reliable soaring, but the lapse chart looks as good as it's likely to get this time of the year for the air quality.

Thursday and Friday might be flyable at Corndon, but at present looks very heavily inverted.

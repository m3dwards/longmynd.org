Monday blown out by all views, even for HG I think.

Tuesday looks a nice Mynd day, some forecasts suggest a bit light for reliable soaring, but the lapse chart looks as good as it's likely to get this time of the year for the air quality.

Thursday and Friday might be flyable at Corndon, but at present looks very heavily inverted.

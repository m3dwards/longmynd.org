Thursday just might be possible at Wrekin SE, but the charts indicate that by about 1500 ASL it's going to be blown out, as there is such a strong wind gradient.  Nice and sunny though.

\---------------------------------------------------

Tuesday (today) at present still looks like a Mynd day.  However, forecasts vary just where the lighter wind areas may be.  The wind could remain WSW or come more on the hill, so in effect it might be too light, just right or a bit windy for PG/HG.  An alternative could be Camlo where it is due to be a bit windier if the Mynd becomes too light.  Lapse chart is excellent for November.

\---------------------------------------------

Monday blown out by all views, even for HG I think.

Tuesday looks a nice Mynd day, some forecasts suggest a bit light for reliable soaring, but the lapse chart looks as good as it's likely to get this time of the year for the air quality.

Thursday and Friday might be flyable at Corndon, but at present looks very heavily inverted.

Monday evening was PG flyable at the Mynd, visible on the webcams, so well done for those that got out.

Wednesday looks like the only bright spot in the week, with light and increasing winds from east veering to the south in the day.  However the forecasts have changed a lot in the last 24 hours, with the thermalling conditions much less than before, so with lots of front passing today and then on Thursday that nice slot might get lost.

Options Corndon early on and throughout the day, or Wrekin SE afternoon onwards.  Current Rasp gives Wrekin as the best place unless you go to north of England or Scotland - fingers crossed it's right.

\-------------------------------------------

Monday is supposed to be thundery, but I think there could well be a chance to fly the Mynd this evening as long as there's no monsters about.  Yesterday evening we watched the thunderstorm that was roughly over the Shepherds Tump area - and we were well over 50 miles away - most impressive but no sound just the lights display.

Tuesday generally rainy

Wednesday looks promising for ridge soaring, east or SE so Corndon or Wrekin.

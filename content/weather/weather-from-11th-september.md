Monday is supposed to be thundery, but I think there could well be a chance to fly the Mynd this evening as long as there's no monsters about.  Yesterday evening we watched the thunderstorm that was roughly over the Shepherds Tump area - and we were well over 50 miles away - most impressive but no sound just the lights display.

Tuesday generally rainy

Wednesday looks promising for ridge soaring, east or SE so Corndon or Wrekin.

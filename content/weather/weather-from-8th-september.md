Monday looks the only probably day but most likely only for HG's, broadly SW so Clatter most in line with the direction.  There is a chance of some towering Cu that could get in the way, and also block the wind temporarily.  Rest of the week looks windy and or wet, but it might improve.

I don't know but the the HG national comp may be at Clatter today?

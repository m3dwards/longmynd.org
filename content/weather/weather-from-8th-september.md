Tuesday,  marginally less windy than yesterday just maybe, but direction much more southerly.  Big clouds but not stormy.  Camlo looks possible for HG BOS comp, but as it is supposed to be less windy further east, Corndon may be a possibility for PG.  Wrekin far too iffy as a spine back in this wind.

\---------------------

Monday looks the only probably ok day but most likely only for HG's, broadly SW so Clatter most in line with the direction.  There is a chance of some towering Cu that could get in the way, and also block the wind temporarily.  Rest of the week looks windy and or wet, but it might improve.

I don't know but the the HG national comp may be at Clatter today?

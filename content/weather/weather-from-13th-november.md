Thursday has forecasts varying in every possible direction, but most show light Westerly some of the time. Most show no rain, but one at least does say there's a chance.  Friday is now looking less likely to be soarable and varying during the day backing from NW to S.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Forecasts vary a lot for Friday as we are on the edge of major variations in weather and wind speeds, but it is worth watching for, to see how things progress.

November running true to form.  I was hoping that Wednesday would be a westerly Mynd day, but at present looks borderline too windy for HG and definitely blown out for PG.  Friday still holds a very slim chance with strong SW winds and some rain chance.

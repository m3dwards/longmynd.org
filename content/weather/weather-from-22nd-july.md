Saturday is due to be WSW to W so Mynd and reasonable speeds.  Mid day to early afternoon a good chance of towering cu and showers but clears later.  Sunday too light for ridge soaring with a S to SSE wind, but nicely thermic and dry.  Wrekin or just maybe Corndon for thermalling pilots.

\-----------------------------------------

Friday has a variation on forecasts but only a little, basically W to WSW and windier in the far west, but still likely to be quite windy at the Long Mynd.  Looks ideal for HG and quite possibly top end or beyond for PG's some/much of the time.  Cloudbase fairly high 4000ft plus and thermic with only a low chance of showers.

Saturday at this moment looks better in wind speeds but much more likely to have some showers during the day, similar wind direction.

\----------------------------------------------

Tuesday is due to be a lot lighter winds further west in our area.  It is also due to dry up and get nice but with post frontal unstable air very soon.  So it might be too windy at the Wrekin, too light at long Mountain, it all depends just where the light winds sit.  direction on most forecasts is NW, but some say N.  Lawley can work surprising well even when the wind is well to the north so that might be a good compromise, or Clunbury.  For low airtime pilots this evening looks ideal.

\------------------------

Windy today, but Tuesday and Wednesday looks nice, NW on Tuesday and SW on Wednesday and at present both days look like being ridge soarable.  Then Thursday does not look great but Friday onwards is quite promising again.

For Tuesday at present it looks too far off for the Mynd to be ideal so our other NW sites look a better option.

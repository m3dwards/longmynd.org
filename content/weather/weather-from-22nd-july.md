Windy today, but Tuesday and Wednesday looks nice, NW on Tuesday and SW on Wednesday and at present both days look like being ridge soarable.  Then Thursday does not look great but Friday onwards is quite promising again.

For Tuesday at present it looks too far off for the Mynd to be ideal so our other NW sites look a better option.

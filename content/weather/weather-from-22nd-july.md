Tuesday is due to be a lot lighter winds further west in our area.  It is also due to dry up and get nice but with post frontal unstable air very soon.  So it might be too windy at the Wrekin, too light at long Mountain, it all depends just where the light winds sit.  direction on most forecasts is NW, but some say N.  Lawley can work surprising well even when the wind is well to the north so that might be a good compromise, or Clunbury.  For low airtime pilots this evening looks ideal.

\------------------------

Windy today, but Tuesday and Wednesday looks nice, NW on Tuesday and SW on Wednesday and at present both days look like being ridge soarable.  Then Thursday does not look great but Friday onwards is quite promising again.

For Tuesday at present it looks too far off for the Mynd to be ideal so our other NW sites look a better option.

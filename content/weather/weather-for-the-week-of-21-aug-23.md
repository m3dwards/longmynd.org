This week continues to be dominated by low pressure to the north and high to the south bringing frontal systems barreling across the UK, very much a North / South split in the weather with westerly winds although we might get a ridge pushing across later in the week. 

**Monday** looking blown out, winds SW gusting to 30mph.

**Tuesday** still looking too strong during the day, WSW winds. Easing in the evening though so potentially an evening Mynd flight?

**Wednesday** looks very promising with soarable winds, W backing WSW with a 3500ft cloudbase, bright early on maybe overcast in the afteroon. Base a bit low for long XCs but potentially a good soaring day. 

**Thursday** brings light SW/ SSW winds, more cloud and some rain in the afternoon.

**Friday** winds veer NNW, its looks like we see the passage of a cold front bringing some heavy rain but it could well be worth keeping an eye on?

**Saturday** potentially a Mynd day with westerly winds but low confidence this far out.

Looking further ahead the BBC says "There is no sign of any notable heat for late summer or early autumn but conditions could warm somewhat by mid-September as high pressure potentially builds towards the UK. This would also make for drier conditions, although occasional frontal systems would still bring occasional rain especially to northernmost areas."

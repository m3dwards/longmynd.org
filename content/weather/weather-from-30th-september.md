Looks too windy for Wrekin today (Friday), but maybe Corndon will be ok, it's safe if blown back there!  Nice generally pleasant weather though with inversion rising to 3000ft.  

Saturday looks windier.  Sunday might be flyable early on but a chance of rain later (possibly thunderstorms just maybe), also early on a strong wind gradient.

\--------------------------------------------------

Plenty of time for it to change, but Thursday looks on to ridge soar Corndon east face and Friday the south face or better still Wrekin.  Until then blown out.

Tuesday looks a great cross country day for Hang Gliders, from Clatter most likely, but is expected to be top end or beyond for PG's to launch, especially as the wind is due to increase during the day.   Camlo not ideal for PG's with a strong wind due to the forest behind and Shepherds Tump is difficult to launch in a strong wind as well.

Wednesday is no good, then Thursday looks promising but forecasts vary a lot, possibly East or SE at this moment, but as the Synoptic charts show us being between systems, it could change a lot by then.

Weekend might be ok, if not too windy for PG's.

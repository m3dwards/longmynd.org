Now I think Wrekin could well be blown out for safe launching and the wind might be a bit too far to the east for part of the day, though is due to back further south.  Corndon might be a better bet for soaring as it is windier in the west of our area and Corndon can take a lot of wind with safe launching (not a spine back).

\----------------------------------

Thursday has winds around here between east and ESE, so not ideal for Wrekin and probably too light for Corndon to ridge soar, but will be ideal for thermalling, apart from Corndon being such a lottery to get away from in light winds.

Friday might be ok Wrekin if it's not too strong wind.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wednesday look soarable at Corndon with a brisk East wind in the afternoon after the rain has passed, grey and overcast but suitable for soaring I think.  Whereas Thursday looks a nicer sunny day but less wind and not staying east and a lot lighter in strength and less suited to ridge soaring.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday looks a great cross country day for Hang Gliders, from Clatter most likely, but is expected to be top end or beyond for PG's to launch, especially as the wind is due to increase during the day.   Camlo not ideal for PG's with a strong wind due to the forest behind and Shepherds Tump is difficult to launch in a strong wind as well.

Wednesday is no good, then Thursday looks promising but forecasts vary a lot, possibly East or SE at this moment, but as the Synoptic charts show us being between systems, it could change a lot by then.

Weekend might be ok, if not too windy for PG's.

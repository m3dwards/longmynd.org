Dear LMSC Members

There will be an LMSC social at the Kings Arms, Church Stretton on Tues 29th August starting around 7pm. http://kingsarmschurchstretton.co.uk/

Chips and sandwiches will be on offer, no need to book, just turn up for a drink, chat and a bite to eat. 

A reminder will be sent out via the Telegram Chat group nearer the day, fingers crossed for some decent flying beforehand.

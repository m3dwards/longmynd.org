Dear Members

Jocky Sanderson will be running his Wilderness First Aid Course on 5/6 Dec 24 at the Inn on the Green, Wentnor.

This is a BHPA approved 16 hour course held over two days, suitable for instructors, tandem pilots or any pilot that wants to be prepared to deal with an incident, particularly in remote locations.

The normal cost is £130 however we have been offered a rate of £100 each for ten participants. The LMSC will also be looking at a subsidy at its next Committee meeting to help offset the cost further depending on how many members have booked.

Tickets are now available on Webcollect on a first come first served basis, if you haven't logged in for a while simply reset your password. [Wilderness First Aid Course 5/6 Dec 24](https://webcollect.org.uk/lmsc/event/wilderness-first-aid-course-5-6-dec-24)

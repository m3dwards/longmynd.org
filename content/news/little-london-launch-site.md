Little London has previously always been part of the Llandinam site guide, however has rarely been flown through no particular fault of it's own.  We have now separated the sites as they are some distance apart, are registered with the BHPA as separate sites and also documented on the CANP system as different locations for Notam activation.

At least there are authorised bottom landing fields and it may be of more interest to low airtime pilots because of this. It also takes a different wind direction to the larger Llandinam launch.

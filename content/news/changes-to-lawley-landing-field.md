As a result of negotiation with Green Farm and the land owner in front of the Lawley a new Landing Field has been designated for Pilots to use.

The blue dotted line indicates a gate and path from the new landing field to a pathway and five bar gate besides Well House. This gains access to the green lane which parallels the Lawley. You can either climb straight up the Lawley from this point to the lower take off or if you turn left back towards the ***i*** on the OS map an easier route back up can be had.



The occupants at Well House are friendly and the narrow Green Lane is vehicular access to their premises. Pilots are requested not to use the Green Lane in a vehicle.



The overhead power line that ran SSE to NNE through the old landing field is still a hazard in the new LZ however more real estate is available. It is advised that pilots on visiting familiarise themselves with the new LZ and the power line before flying.



The land owner requests that practising top to bottoms is not realistic and the LZ should be a bomb out field only. Slope or top landing would be the preferred option.

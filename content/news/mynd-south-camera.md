South Camera now replaced 26th March and video turned on aswell.

\---------------------------------------------------------------

Now that the North camera has been returned to a quality image, it's highlighted how bad the south one is.  A new lens for the south camera is on order and will in time get updated too.  It's a bit of a fiddly job and requires complete dis-assembly of the device and does pose a small risk of destroying the whole unit, but it's worth the risk.

We are now going to try an alternative camera option, similar to the one deployed by North Wales club on Llangollen.  Lets hope it's more reliable and suited to the inhospitable environment of the Long Mynd.  Both cameras are dead at present as the south camera will not charge as the solar panel connections have corroded.

The Mynd North camera will be down a while longer - the solar panel has been completely ripped off the pole - snapped the alloy mounts.  Maybe it will be found in Church Stretton or somewhere else miles away.  It is not physically possible to swap the south camera over to point North.  The South camera is being remotely charged up and will go back up shortly.

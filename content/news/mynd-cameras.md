The Mynd North camera will be down a while longer - the solar panel has been completely ripped off the pole - snapped the alloy mounts.  Maybe it will be found in Church Stretton or somewhere else miles away.  It is not physically possible to swap the south camera over to point North.  The South camera is being remotely charged up and will go back up shortly.

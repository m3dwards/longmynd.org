Please note that a Fast Jet exercise notam directly impacts our sites Monday to Wednesday - Long Mynd, Black Knoll, Corndon,  Lan Fawr and Clunbury.  It also will preclude downwind XC flights from Llandinam, Shepherds Tump and Camlo.  Please see www.notaminfo.com.  Most likely this will impact Tuesday and generally too windy the rest of the time if forecasts hold.

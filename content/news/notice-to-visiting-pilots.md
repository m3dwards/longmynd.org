Non members are reminded that LMSC "members only sites" are classified as such primarily due to safety considerations hence the rules on minimum ratings, minimum hours and club membership. BHPA Rules for Flying Members state that " 7. When flying from club sites, pilots should familiarise themselves, and comply with, the club site rules." In the event of being involved in an incident or accident visiting pilots that have broken site rules may find that their BHPA 3rd Party Insurance is invalidated. On a more positive note we welcome visitors and the club does have short term membership options available including an online day membership or 10 day membership at https://longmynd.org/ üëç

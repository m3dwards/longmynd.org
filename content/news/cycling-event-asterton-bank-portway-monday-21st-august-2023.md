On the evening of **Monday 21st of August**  there will be a short, competitive 'hill climb' event up Asterton Bank/The Port Way with Paramount cycling club. 

LMSC members  are encouraged to get involved, cheering competitors on in a quintessentially British display of athleticism and masochism! 

They anticipate **no more than 50 minutes of disruption to traffic on The Port Way from 7pm** and would therefore appreciate it if our members plan their travel into and out of the area accordingly.

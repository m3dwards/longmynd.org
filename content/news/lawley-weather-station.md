The camera is working again, no idea why, but it restarted working in the middle of a big storm. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------

Sadly the camera has disconnected from the main unit.  It is a major undertaking to investigate due to it's location and the failure my be permanent with no replacement parts available due to the age of the machine.  The weather station continues to function as usual.

\---------------------------------------

Our website is now showing current weather and photo's but about 20% of the time the photographs are not coming through - much better than before, but still not a good enough internet signal.

The O2 sim card never worked very well once it was moved from Sarn to the Lawley with really intermittent connectivity and usually too poor to work the camera.  If  the camera was operating it often turned the whole unit off for a day.  The club have today replaced the O2 SIM card with a different network provider in the hope that it is much better, more reliable and runs the camera which is what takes all the data network bandwidth.

Many thanks to Dave Bibby and Geoff Minshull for helping me hang onto the ladder to carry out the work.

A reminder to those not familiar with the Lawley, it's right at the very top and always a lot windier there than where people usually launch from, so don't go thinking the weather station is over-reading.

The O2 sim card never worked very well once it was moved from Sarn to the Lawley with really intermittent connectivity and usually too poor to work the camera.  If  the camera was operating it often turned the whole unit off for a day.  The club have today replaced the O2 SIM card with a different network provider in the hope that it is much better, more reliable and runs the camera which is what takes all the data network bandwidth.

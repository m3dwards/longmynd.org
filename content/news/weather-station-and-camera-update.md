**Current status as of January 2026**

Clatter weather and camera, all good

Lawley weather and camera, good but image is less than perfect but not scheduled for replacement yet

Mynd weather, all good

Mynd South - due to corrosion cannot charge, will be replaced by the redundant North camera soon

Mynd North - a totally new camera is being trialled at present, but due to constraints imposed by manufacturer will only be viewable by paid up club members using mobile phones - ideally Android.  Advantages are that it is massively cheaper to buy than Solarcam, big solar panel and batteries, real time live video, can be zoomed in and you can look at previous videos just whenever you like.

Clatter camera replaced and weather station re-installed and all working great so far (02/04/2025).

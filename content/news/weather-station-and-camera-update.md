Update - Solarcam say that UV has caused permanent damage - A common issue recently discovered.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have looked back at images taken exactly two years ago and I could not believe how much the image quality has deteriorated,  I suppose it's like eyesight, you don't realise how good it used to be as it's a gradual deterioration. Anyway, I'm waiting for advice from the manufacturer, but my guess is will be for a new device as there's nothing I can do regarding cleaning and I've tried the highest level of quality image which create huge files but no better.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

North camera cleaned again 29th Feb,  I think there is a very marginal improvement,  but at least its better than all the cameras that are not working!

\-----------------------------------

Cameras at the Long Mynd now back up, picture quality has not improved much though.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update - The Mynd North camera is totally dead from 19th December - flat battery and has auto-powered off until it is manually recharged and rebooted.  Lenses will be cleaned on North and South too, hopefully to get the picture quality back again.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Mynd cameras both north and south are working intermittently as the solar panels are not getting enough energy at present for the next month or two.  May have to turn video off to allow the batteries to build up a bit more.  A visit is required to try to clean the camera lens as the picture quality is now very poor, so batteries can be remotely charged then.

The Mynd weather station is working fine.

Clatter camera also needs a visit and a clean, but the weather station is working fine.

Lawley weather station is working intermittently due to poor data signal at the top of the hill.  A potential fix has been organised and just waiting for suitable weather and people to be available to carry that out and if it works better the camera will be turned on.

The Llangollen camera is nothing to do with us, just on our website with kind permission of the North Wales club, unfortunately it's not been very reliable.

Similarly the Welshpool and Llandovery camera images.

It's officially winter so the video has been turned off from 2nd December on both cameras to reduce the chance of batteries getting too low to run the still camera images.  Will go back on when we start getting longer daytimes in 2025.

Well that didn't last long, now turned back off as the batteries had got low really quickly.

\-------------------------------------

As the batteries are currently fully charged, the video has been turned back on for both North and South camera images.  If the batteries drain too much before we head into to summer months, they might have to be turned back off for a while.  Hopefully we should be ok to keep the camera still images running now that the days are getting a bit longer.

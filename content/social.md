Supervised Parachute Repack - Saturday 18 March 2023

£5 per repack. Tea & Coffee provided\
Rushbury Village Hall, Wall under Heywood, Church Stretton\
Start Times spilt into 2 sessions : 1PM & 4PM

**Please email club \[at] longmynd.org to request a form to book to attend.**

We have 20 spaces – reply to reserve a space. Then simply pay the £5 per repack to secure your place. Details for online payment will be sent once you have reserved a space.

Please bring your own copy of the reserve manual and harness its being fitted to, for extra point research and safety notices.  This will save a lot of time. Ideally do not detach your parachute from the harness or the lines can get twisted easily.

This is a great opportunity to learn or to revise how to repack your own reserve while having the backup of a qualified repacker for any queries!\
We are pleased to have a qualified BHPA parachute repacker and a repacker ‘in training’ (has completed the BHPA course, now needs lots of practice to get signed off!) on hand.\
Remember parachutes should be repacked at least once a year or more depending on what your manual advises. Get yours sorted before the good weather arrives.\
Note your parachute will not be repacked for you but a demonstration repack will take place at 1pm and 4pm, thereafter the repackers will supervise repacks, help where needed and answer any queries.\
Initially its 1 repack per person but if spaces remain and you have indicated you would like more than 1 repack, we’ll get back to confirm.\
Unfortunately due to the extra time needed, Rogallo reserves cannot be repacked at the event (well maybe 1 if time permits!).\
However Rogallo’s can be left for a ‘take away’ paid repack as can any reserves you prefer to drop off for a full repack by a BHPA qualified repacker (these will be taken away and not done on the Saturday). Subject to availability, 1st come 1st served.

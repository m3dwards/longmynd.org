Dear Members and Friends

**LMSC Summer BBQ Friday 12th July 2024**.  The BBQ venue will again be the Red Lion, Longden Common Shrewsbury SY5 8AE, start time about 7pm onwards. For those travelling from further afield why not make a flying weekend of it, camping is available nearby, please read on. 

**Venue**. The Red Lion at Longden Common is country pub and a proven venue with great reviews. The marquee will be available for use in case of inclement weather as well as for the evening entertainment which is family friendly so please bring partners and children along?

The pub lies on the road between Shrewsbury and Wentnor, just a few miles the Long Mynd. Location here: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/j9qw34WX9Eq9AwMG7>

**Entertainment.** This year we are bringing back the Battlefield Bird of Prey Centre to give us a display and presentation on our friends in the air including Buzzards, Kites, Falcons, Hawks and Owls. Steve will give his presentation taking questions and answers about their capabilities and habits including the loan of a thick leather glove if you fancy getting more up close and personal. We are still working on a guest speaker to follow the meal.

**Camping**. For those more far flung members we have touched base with the local campsite which is half a mile from the Red Lion but this will need booking individually in advance. Please mention that you are with the LMSC. Tents and campervans welcome, camping and glamping -

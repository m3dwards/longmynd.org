  - sensitivity: Like Corndon, this site is only available for pilots with at least
      25 hours, or more, after completing their BHPA CP rating. No red
      streamers! It can be a technical site if the wind is anything other than
      North, to North-Northeast. Because it is used when winds are too strong at
      Corndon, it can be easy to launch into quite strong winds and then have
      trouble penetrating forwards. Despite the large launch area, the site can
      seem quite busy in the air when soaring over the launch field area. Take
      care to give other pilots plenty of space. If pilots are restricted to
      soaring the take-off field, then two pilots together is probably the
      maximum safe number unless they are getting plenty of height.
  - sensitivity: All feedback after flying this site is welcomed as it has only been
      negotiated since the previous launch, at Sarn, was lost to the club.
      Please note that the lanes close by are narrow and we must take great care
      to stay on good terms with the local landowners and their neighbours. Park
      respectfully and always stick to the footpaths when accessing the site.
accessAndParking: >-
  The landowning farmer is happy for us to park in the farmyard and walk up, or
  you may wish to park on the edge of the road to the immediate east of launch
  and save a lot of vertical climbing.  If so, please make sure you park
  completely off the road and not in the passing place, as the road is very
  narrow.  Do not walk or fly from the fields to the south of launch (higher up
  the hill), as these are owned by someone else, and we do not have permission
  to use these fields.\


  As re-negotiations with the landowner of the old Sarn site are ongoing, please do not launch or land on, or near to, that launch field. We are still hopeful that we can gain access to the old Sarn field in the future and any infringement of the agreement to not fly it will not go down well.\


  Please do not climb fences, there are three access points all of which have gates to pass through so there is no need to climb any fence.

  * T/O altitude 1160 ft AMSL

  * Top to bottom 550 ft

  * Take-off and top landing is straightforward in the large field suitable for North to North-Northeast winds. Take-off if the wind has any west in it is more technical.

  * Bottom landing is in the flat field marked.

  * The actual launch fields are not at the top of the hill, but on a steeper lip of the hill – the fields directly to the south are sloping but much more gently.  There are two launch fields; the one which is suitable for N to NNE launching is clear grass with few thistles and it is possible to slope land on it and has few obstructions in front.  The field to the West, which could take a launch when just West of North, does have two large trees lower down the slope which may create launch air turbulence.

  * No paramotors are allowed to use this site.

  * No dogs are allowed.

See map\
A – Paraglider bottom landing and very limited parking – 1 or 2 cars but is right next to the bottom landing field

B – Hang Glider landing field

C – The landowners farm – parking is allowed, please park near the barns but not blocking any access and say hello to the landowners if they are about

D – The easiest least hilly walking route – parking very, very limited – 2 in the winter maybe none in the summer.  There are no other places to park on the road other that to park at the very top of the hill on the Kerry ridgeway drovers road and walk down

E – This is the launch field that takes N to NNE

F – This is the launch field that takes N to NNW

G - Park on verge along Drovers road and walk down the green lane, longer walk but easy

The blue lines mark the walking routes

Note that on the green map, where it says Holfuy field, this is where the old Sarn Holfuy weather station used to be located and the pole is still there next to the fence at the top of the NNW facing launch field.

### Information

Red Hopton is not a direct replacement for the former ‘Sarn’ site, which we are not currently allowed to launch from, or land at.  However, it is very close to that site and the launch fields are owned by the same farmer as the previous landing field which remains as the landing field for this site.\

Red Hopton is often considered as suitable to fly when Corndon is very windy or blown out, and the wind is just a bit too much North or NNE for Long Mountain to be ideal. The ridge is a good trigger for thermals that develop in the flatlands to the North and there are many raptors around. It has good XC potential.\

Negotiations with other landowners nearby are ongoing. Please do not launch, land on, or near to, the old Sarn site launch field. We are still hopeful that we may be able to regain access to that field once again. Any infringement of the current ‘no-fly’ agreement for the old Sarn fields, will not go down well.\

The launch fields for Red Hopton are not at the top of the hill, but on a steeper lip of the hill – the fields directly to the South, between the launch and the drovers’ road, are sloping, but much more gently.  There are two launch fields. The one which is suitable for N to NNE launching is clear grass with few thistles. It is possible to slope land on this field safely and this field has no obstructions in front.  The field to the West, which can take a launch when winds are just West of North, has two large trees lower down the slope. Take care here as these trees may produce some local turbulence.\

Please do not climb fences. There are three access points, all have gates to pass through so there is no need to climb any fence. Doing so could alienate the landowners.

**Positive attributes**

The N-NNE launch field is large and smooth. The ridge then steepens below the field boundary. Red Hopton is closer to the official bottom landing field than our previous ‘Sarn’ site and has a TTB of around 550ft. \

The launch field also has good potential for slope landing. The run up of the slope to the hill provides potential of a longer soaring ridge.  The N-NNW field is very steep. Because it has trees in front of it, it is less well suited to slope landing and may be less suited to launching too. This depends on the pilots’ experience and local wind strength and direction, but the trees could also represent a significant risk.

**Possible concerns**

If the wind is off to the East, then turbulence from the gully to the right of the launch and the nearby forest may be encountered.  If the wind is Northwest then turbulence from the front of Pant hill and the valley may be encountered. The best wind direction is limited to North or, ideally, just east of North.\

There is row of small trees alongside a small gully that runs across the foot of the launch field. Be aware that this may also generate some small local turbulence as you fly out over the steeper part of the ridge.\

We don’t have permission to land on any other fields other than the launch and landing fields shown on the map.  However, there are a number of gently sloping fields to the southeast of launch but beware of power lines. Don’t be concerned about bottom landing. It is a relatively easy walk up to take-off on a good public path. It takes less than 30 minutes.\

The whole area is heavily used for game bird farming and shooting. The landowners will have many concerns regarding our activity that relate to these birds. This may impact the availability of the site from time to time.

#### WARNING

This area is used by low flying military aircraft on weekdays.  The day before, please use <https://canp.logans.me.uk/> and select Red Hopton.

#### CONTROLLED AIRSPACE

Shobden Airfield is 30Km to the Southeast and the Military Danger Area: D203 Mynedd Eppynt is 43Km to the South Southwest.

#### ACCESS AND PARKING

The landowning farmer is happy for us to park in the farmyard and walk up, or you may wish to park on the edge of the road to the immediate east of launch and save a lot of vertical climbing.  If so, please make sure you park completely off the road and not in the passing place, as the road is very narrow.  Do not walk or fly from the fields to the south of launch (higher up the hill), as these are owned by someone else, and we do not have permission to use these fields.\

As re-negotiations with the landowner of the old Sarn site are ongoing, please do not launch or land on, or near to, that launch field. We are still hopeful that we can gain access to the old Sarn field in the future and any infringement of the agreement to not fly it will not go down well.\

Please do not climb fences, there are three access points all of which have gates to pass through so there is no need to climb any fence.\

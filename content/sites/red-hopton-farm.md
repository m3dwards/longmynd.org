sensitivities:
  - sensitivity: This site is at present a purely experimental site for highly
      experienced pilots who are members of the Long Mynd Soaring Club only
  - sensitivity: You must email ‘safety at longmynd.org’ whenever you go there,
      especially if you visit the site and decide not to fly if it appears
      unsuitable for any reason.  Provide the date, wind and weather conditions
      and comments regarding the flying.  In due course the plan will be to open
      up the site to pilots of a lower level of skill and experience, therefore
      your feedback on this matter is critical.
accessAndParking: >-
  The landowning farmer is happy for us to park in the farmyard and walk up, or
  you may wish to park on the edge of the road to the immediate east of launch
  and save a lot of vertical climb.  If so please make sure you park completely
  off the road and not in the passing place, as the road is very narrow.  Do not
  walk or fly from the fields to the south of launch (higher up the hill), as
  these are owned by someone else and we do not as yet have permission.


  As re-negotiations with the landowner of the old Sarn site are ongoing, please do not launch or land on or near that launch field as we are still hopeful that we can gain access once again and any infringement of the agreement to not fly it will not go down well.


  Please do not climb fences, there are three access points all of which have gates to pass through so there is no need to climb any fence.
flying: >-
  * T/O altitude 1160 ft AMSL

  * Top to bottom 550 ft

  * Take-off and top landing are straightforward.

  * Bottom landing is in the flat field marked.

  * The actual launch fields are not at the top of the hill, but on a steeper lip of the hill – the fields directly to the south are sloping but much more gently.  There are two launch fields,  The one which is suitable for N to NNE launching is clear grass with few thistles and it is possible to slope land on it and has no obstructions in front.  The field to the west which could take a launch when just West of North does have two large trees lower down the slope which are likely to create launch air turbulence.

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

A – Paraglider bottom landing and very limited parking – 1 or 2 cars but is right next to the bottom landing field

B – Hang Glider landing field

C – The landowners farm – parking is allowed, please park near the barns but not blocking any access and say hello to the landowners if they are about

D – the easiest least hilly walking route – parking very, very limited – 2 in the winter maybe none in the summer.  There are no other places to park on the road other that to park at the very top of the hill on the Kerry ridgeway drovers road and walk down

E – this is the launch field that takes N to NNE

F – This is the launch field that takes N to NNW

The blue lines mark the walking routes

Note that on the green map, where it says Holfuy field, this is where the old Sarn Holfuy weather station used to be located and the pole is still there next to the fence at the top of the NNW facing launch field.

### Information

This site is not a direct replacement for the former ‘Sarn’ site, which we are not currently allowed to launch or land at.  However, it is very close to that site and the launch fields are owned by the same farmer as the previous landing field which remains as the landing field for this site.

So far, it has only been launched from in the rather unusual completely perfect soaring  conditions, therefore until more information is gathered by experienced pilots the club considers that only Pilot rated with at least 100 hours are to fly it, as this reduces the risk of unexpected events due to incorrect site appreciation or launch, flying and landing skills which may from time to time be required here.

In the limited experience we have, this site should be considered as suitable to fly when Corndon is very windy or near blown out, and the wind is just a bit too much North or NNE for Long Mountain to be ideal.  As experience of the site is gained and during the thermic season, it may be suitable for ab-initio TTB training and XC flights, but we don’t know yet.

 As re-negotiations with the landowner of the old Sarn site are ongoing, please do not launch or land on or near that launch field as we are still hopeful that we can gain access once again and any infringement of the agreement to not fly it will not go down well.

 The actual launch fields are not at the top of the hill, but on a steeper lip of the hill – the fields directly to the south are sloping but much more gently.  There are two launch fields,  The one which is suitable for N to NNE launching is clear grass with few thistles and it is possible to slope land on it and has no obstructions in front.  The field to the west which could take a launch when just West of North does have two large trees lower down the slope which are likely to create launch air turbulence.

Please do not climb fences, there are three access points all of which have gates to pass through so there is no need to climb any fence.

**Positive attributes**

The N-NNE launch field is super smooth and the hill then steepens below it and has a TTB of around 550ft.  It is physically closer to the bottom landing than the old ‘Sarn’ site.  This field is good for slope landing. The actual run up of the slope to the hill provides a longer potential soaring ridge.  The N-NNW field is very steep and with trees in front less suited to slope landing and may be less suited to launching.  The launching and soaring wind direction and strength enhances the clubs overall coverage of wind directions for our sites.

**Possible concerns**

If the wind is well NNE, then turbulence from the gully and forest may be encountered.  If the wind is NW then turbulence from the front of Pant hill and the valley may be encountered, therefore at present the wind direction expected to be suitable is very limited to North and ideally just east of North.

We don’t yet have permission to land on any other fields other than launch and landing.  However, there are a number of gently sloping fields to the south east of launch, but beware of the power lines – on the assumption that we can gain authority to use them.  The whole area is heavily used for game shooting, and the landowners will have concerns that relate to the birds not just during shooting days, so this may impact the availability of the site.

sensitivities:
  - sensitivity: It is essential all pilots are BHPA members for the insurance cover
      this provides, while this is true for all LMSC sites  this site is very
      popular with the public. Be especially careful not to put anyone at risk
      e.g. with poor launches, being blown backwards or top landings (do not
      attempt if there is not ample clear room). Walkers dogs are frequently not
      on leads, try to ensure none can get caught in your lines. If it is busy
      wait till it is clear to launch – politely ask people to move if
      necessary.
  - sensitivity: We may not leave vehicles at the top, however a single 4×4 may
      ferry equipment/pilots up and then be returned to the halfway house – see
      notes below.
  - sensitivity: >+
      Give the mast a good clearance – it has some very expensive equipment
      attached!

  - sensitivity: Fields below may have livestock – please land so as to avoid where
      possible!

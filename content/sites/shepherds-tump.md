  South east off the A488 at Llanfihangel Rhydithon by a church. Follow the
  road/track up the hill. Park on the side of the track before the barn and walk
  to T/O on the right.


  Dolau train station (with connections from Shrewsbury) is half a mile from the end of the track so easily within walking distance – good for if you go XC.

The SSW / SW face is very steep but has a nice rounded top with no trees, bushes, bracken to worry about, and only one fence a long way back, so looks ideal for ground handling as well as the less experienced to practice launching – slope landing would be very technical though. The bottom landing fields often have cows and calves in them – best to go and check them out before you launch as the nearest field is partly hidden by trees and the further one is a long way out. Please don’t use cow fields for yours and the animals sake.

There is a very pronounced and tight headed bowl to this hill, and the west facing end of the bowl will work, but suffers with a strong venturi effect. Plenty of space to get blown back though.

There are a multitude of bowls that will work looking in a southerly direction, some of which are official Mid Wales club sites, so you may see pilots on those – farmers need paying for access I understand. They take a variety of wind directions.

Generally I would say not the nicest hill to scratch low on as there are big trees lower down the slope to create turbulence, however the more west there is to the wind the better the landscape is upwind so is probably smoother in that case

Downwind is very nice as the hill drops away as you run in a NE direction along the valley – with train stations along it

The farm at the bottom landing fields has opened a cafe. Visit farmgate2kitchenplate for open hours.

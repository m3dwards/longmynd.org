  Via Plasdinam to Caetwp. Park on the field diagionally opposite the farm,
  close to the hedge making sure not to obstruct the gate. If the ground is wet
  in the field, contact Mr Parry in Caetwp farm for alternative parking. Walk up
  the lane until you reach Cross Keys house on your right. Through the gate and
  turn immediately left through another gate. There is a long carry up the rough
  track. Do not even take a 4WD drive up this track! As the track bears left,
  turn right along the edge to take off.


  Little London site is not accessible by car, park by the bottom landing area only.

Little London has previously always been part of the Llandinam site guide, however has rarely been flown through no particular fault of it's own.  We have now separated the sites as the are some distance apart, are registered with the BHPA as separate sites and also documented on the CANP system as different locations for Notam activation 

The club consider that the site has advantages that make it suitable in the right conditions for all levels of pilot.

So where is it?\
Just to the east of Llandinam village on a separate hill forming the southern slopes  of the valley side of the river Severn.  Mostly wild moorland, but mixed agriculture below in the bottom landing areas. Somehwhare less rough ground than Llandinam for launching.  It takes roughly an hour to drive to from the Long Mynd if you are already there, but can be reached relatively easily by heading towards Newtown on main roads from Welshpool / Newtown etc.

Bottom landing is allowed, further details to confirm will follow, but it is understood that there are power lines so please check out before going up the hill.

So when would you go there in preference to elsewhere?\
When there is very little wind elsewhere, and you want a big hill in a gentle NW to NNW wind. When the wind strength is forecast to be higher to the west of the Mynd. When the thermal strengths are forecast to be better, higher cloudbase or more stable conditions (not overdeveloping to Cunim or spreadout likely). 

The map will be replaced with one more suited to Little London once the landing options have been checked out

sensitivities:
  - sensitivity: Please park sensibly using the available public parking or the
      farmer agreed field as detailed below – never park in a way that would
      block larger farm vehicles or access to gates etc.! Be especially careful
      not to frighten horses in fields below and being ridden. Due to the public
      footpath along the top, take care when launching and top landing!
accessAndParking: >-
  From Shrewsbury, follow the A49, turn left for Longnor and drive through
  Longnor. Go straight on at the crossroads, follow the road round,  and over
  the saddle. Just before the saddle, there is limited public parking on the
  right for a small number of cars. This is just a dirt pull-in, rather than
  paved parking. If you use this, walk straight up the ridge from there.


  Otherwise, take the first farm entrance to the right as you descend the saddle. Park in the first field on the right.  Do not park in the field if it contains sheep. There is normally someone around who can direct you to alternative parking.


  Walk up the back of the ridge via the gate provided. In good conditions, it is possible to take off here and work your way up the ridge to the left. A walk up the ridge gives a better chance of soaring. Most PGs take this option, most HGs do not.
launchesAndLanding: >-
  The new landing field is out front of the lower take off. It is the green
  field with the power line disecting it in this photo. Also shown in photos are
  the five bar gate, path to landing field and field access point.

flying: >-
  * T/O altitude: lower – 850 ft AMSL, upper – 1240 ft AMSL

  * Top to bottom: lower – 350 ft, upper – 740 ft

  * Take-off is straightforward

  * Top landing is virtually impossible for HG

  * Bottom landing (see map) is technically straightforward but there are many POWER LINES and some trees. Check the field out and its condition before flying – this is particularly important for hang gliders. Do NOT LAND in any other field except in real emergency. The ridge is low at T/O end – leave sufficient height for the glide into wind. CLOSE ALL GATES. Note that there is a convenient gate at the side of the landing field, walk up the side of the field to the green lane where there is a 5 bar gate.

  * Pilots are requested not to drive along the green lane to the landing field.

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

  * Please be aware of the mobile network mast. It is set back and should not be an issue however do not launch nor land directly in front in case you are dragged back into it.

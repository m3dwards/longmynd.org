Caer Caradoc



Finding a suitable spot to lay out and launch is very !imited due to the amount of rough heather. There is a very small flat area right on top but the wind would have to be just right to use that. Otherwise its a case of hunting around on the slope near the fortification dyke to lay out a paraglider. You can slope land if you are well skilled by flying up to the spineback ridge and landing on it, but the main NW face is very steep and not suited to slope landing. The hill does ridge soar well in light winds being much bigger than the Lawley.\
If its a light wind day and you were thinking of walking to the very top of the Lawley, then it may be worth trying this hill as the walk is no worse. Also for cross country flying pilots you can park near church stretton to make retrieves easier.

  - sensitivity: Please pay particular attention to access / parking notes below!
accessAndParking: >-
  Turn off the A488 at a derelict tower signposted White Grit/Priest Weston 2km
  to a T junction. Take the rough track to the left. There is more parking
  down this end before the first gate, so consider parking along this track well
  over to the side allowing access for larger farm vehicles to pass and to clear
  the turn into gates. From here its only a brisk 12 minute walk to the second
  gate! (You may continue to drive through the first gate and up to the second
  gate but there is limited parking here and you may be forced to drive back
  down).


  Walking or driving, after 100m go through the 1st gate which MUST BE CLOSED after passing (even if open when you arrive). Approx 1 km to a widened area with gate on the left & gate  on the right – this is at the far edge of a pine plantation (now cut, but obvious where it was). Corndon hill is through the left gate and Lan Fawr is through the right gate but **NB no vehicles through these gates, both to Corndon & Lan Fawr pilots must walk from these second gates across to T/O**.  Park allowing access for larger farm vehicles to pass and to clear the turn through gates. Driving through these second gates could result in the loss of these sites – please don’t do it and please tell any other pilots not to do so! The walk from second gate to take off is easy and about 10 minutes.

  * Bottom landing is easy in the flat field marked. There are reasonable alternatives in an emergency.

      This site is very popular with the public. Be especially careful not to
      put anyone at

      risk e.g. with poor launches, being blown backwards or top landings (do not attempt

      if there is not ample clear room). Walkers dogs are frequently not on leads, try to

      ensure none can get caught in your lines. If it is busy wait till it is clear to launch –

      politely ask people to move if necessary.
  - sensitivity: We may not leave vehicles at the top, however a single 4×4 may
      ferry equipment/pilots up and then be returned to the halfway house – see
      notes below.
  - sensitivity: >+
      Give the mast a good clearance – it has some very expensive equipment
      attached!

  - sensitivity: Fields below may have livestock – please land so as to avoid where
      possible!

  M54 junction 7, turn South. At 0.8 miles, close to a ‘T’ junction, the access track climbs off to the right. Parking is in the Wrekin Forest Glen, Ercall or new car park (see image) or the (now much reduced) roadside parking.  Traffic wardens regularly ticket those parking over the double yellow lines. It is ok to take a 4×4 vehicle up to the entrance to the TV mast,  drop your kit off, and return the vehicle  to the Halfway House and park the said vehicle  on the left hand side of the gate (looking up the Wrekin) – do not leave a vehicle anywhere on top of the hill, the Halfway House is the ONLY place where we have permission to leave a single vehicle on the hill.

  #### BOTTOM LANDING


  PG


  The NW PG bottom landing options cannot be seen from launch. In some conditions, especially if the wind has some North in it, it might not be possible to make the official fields. Be especially careful not to be caught out – there is a significant amount of forest to pass over! If in doubt, head out early to clear the forest!


  There are two official options marked on the map. Both fields join onto the lane known as Wrekin Course. It is strongly advised that you familiarize yourself with these fields before flying for your own safety:


  1. The small field, known as the Firing Range (inactive). This field is small, narrow and has one metre high banks across it which can be obscured if the grass is long. NB: the banks have deep holes at regular intervals into which the riflemen would lower themselves, take care to avoid these holes (and banks) when landing and when walking over the field. NB This is a small and technical field to land in, do look at it from below before considering whether to fly the hill or not! field further to the right of the Firing Range (i.e. not adjacent) as indicated on the map can be used, but ONLY if there are no horses in it. Please check before flying. This field has a power line within it.

  2. The other landing field, also marked on the map is adjacent to the Firing Range field is also available for landings when it is not in crop, or there is livestock on it. 


  HG


  There is one official NW HG (& PG) field (see the map above) – please do not use if the field is ploughed and beware of the power line.
flying: >-
  * T/O altitude 1335 ft AMSL

  * Top to bottom 830 ft (SE side less at 580 ft)

  * Take-off: Take off from the ‘lip’ in strong conditions. Trees to the right of launch can play a major part in giving a false wind direction & anything N of NW could result in rotor/turbulence.

  * Top landing: not advisable. Note the NW rotor marked on the map. Be especially careful to avoid members of the public and dogs if you attempt it. If your chosen landing area is busy then rather keep soaring or bottom land – its not acceptable to yell to people to move out of your way in preparing to top land nor to land close to members of the public.

  * Bottom landing: see below

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

#### SPECTATORS AND THE PUBLIC

The Wrekin is a popular walking spot for the public and can be busy, please respect this and launch and fly sensibly. Take care not to be dragged back into the path of spectators and do not attempt to top land if people are in the way.

**NB**

It is recommended your first visit, at least, is with someone suitably experienced in flying the site in different conditions. Also look at the bottom landing options before heading up to launch.

#### WARNING

Fields not marked ‘HG’ slope steeply. An up-slope/down wind landing is the only practical method for HG in an emergency.

      this provides, while this is true for all LMSC sites  this site is very
      popular with the public. Be especially careful not to put anyone at risk
      e.g. with poor launches, being blown backwards or top landings (do not
      attempt if there is not ample clear room). Walkers dogs are frequently not
      on leads, try to ensure none can get caught in your lines. If it is busy
      wait till it is clear to launch – politely ask people to move if
      necessary.
  - sensitivity: We may not leave vehicles at the top, however a single 4×4 may
      ferry equipment/pilots up and then be returned to the halfway house – see
      notes below.

      Give the mast a good clearance – it has some very expensive equipment
      attached!

  - sensitivity: Fields below may have livestock – please land so as to avoid where
      possible!
accessAndParking: M54 junction 7, turn South. At 0.8 miles, close to a ‘T’
  junction, the access track climbs off to the right. Parking is in the Wrekin
  Forest Glen or Ercall car parks or the (now much reduced) roadside parking.
  The Forest Glen car park will soon require payment by card or online (due May
  2022). Traffic wardens regularly ticket those parking over the double yellow
  lines. It is ok to take a 4×4 vehicle up to the entrance to the TV mast,  drop
  your kit off, and return the vehicle  to the Halfway House and park the said
  vehicle  on the left hand side of the gate (looking up the Wrekin) – do not
  leave a vehicle anywhere on top of the hill, the Halfway House is the ONLY
  place where we have permission to leave a single vehicle on the hill.

  #### BOTTOM LANDING


  PG


  The NW PG bottom landing options cannot be seen from launch. In some conditions, especially if the wind has some North in it, it might not be possible to make the official fields. Be especially careful not to be caught out – there is a significant amount of forest to pass over! If in doubt, head out early to clear the forest!


  There are two official options; it is strongly advised that you familiarize yourself with these fields before flying for your own safety:


  1) The field further to the right of the Firing Range (i.e. not adjacent) as indicated on the map can be used, but ONLY if there are no horses in it. Please check before flying. This field has a power line within it.] UPDATE -  29 July 2022 – The Wrekin landing field on the NW side, marked C on the site guide, is being developed into a car park and café. Work has now started & although it will likely drag on, we do not know what will be done when so **for safety reasons we are removing it as an official landing field. Please do not land here** - apart from the safety risk, the landowner additionally kindly grants us access to the Wrekin and to the Rifle Range landing field.


  2) The Firing Range which is currently inactive. This field is small, narrow and has one metre high banks across it which can be obscured if the grass is long. NB: the banks have deep holes at regular intervals into which the riflemen would lower themselves, take care to avoid these holes (and banks) when landing and when walking over the field. NB This is a small and technical field to land in, do look at it from below before considering whether to fly the hill or not! We may land in the fields either side of the Firing Range when they are not in crop.


  HG


  There is one official NW HG (& PG) field (see the map above) – please do not use if the field is ploughed and beware of the power line.
flying: >-
  * T/O altitude 1335 ft AMSL

  * Top to bottom 830 ft (SE side less at 580 ft)

  * Take-off: Take off from the ‘lip’ in strong conditions. Trees to the right of launch can play a major part in giving a false wind direction & anything N of NW could result in rotor/turbulence.

  * Top landing: not advisable. Note the NW rotor marked on the map. Be especially careful to avoid members of the public and dogs if you attempt it. If your chosen landing area is busy then rather keep soaring or bottom land – its not acceptable to yell to people to move out of your way in preparing to top land nor to land close to members of the public.

  * Bottom landing: see below

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

#### SPECTATORS AND THE PUBLIC

The Wrekin is a popular walking spot for the public and can be busy, please respect this and launch and fly sensibly. Take care not to be dragged back into the path of spectators and do not attempt to top land if people are in the way.

**NB**

It is recommended your first visit, at least, is with someone suitably experienced in flying the site in different conditions. Also look at the bottom landing options before heading up to launch.

#### WARNING

Fields not marked ‘HG’ slope steeply. An up-slope/down wind landing is the only practical method for HG in an emergency.

#### SITE RULES

* Pilots must be current LMSC members or have requested (with your BHPA number) and received confirmation of a days temporary pass
* Pilots must be suitably rated & licensed members of the BHPA.
* All members shall observe the Countryside Code, in particular in relation to property and livestock. No livestock are to be frightened or stampeded by fliers.

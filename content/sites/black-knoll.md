  There is limited parking off the road by the track leading up to the take off, marked 'P' on the map. This can be busy if the school is active.  If it is full, there is also a small quarry a little further along the road. **DO NOT DRIVE UP THE TRACK.** Park right at the back close up to the hill, allowing the farmer to turn right from his track onto the road. Blocking this right turn will cause him a huge amount of trouble, so car sharing is essential.

  * This site is at the extreme south end of the Mynd, and should be considered
  as an adjunct to the main Long Mynd site. Wind direction is the same
  (WSW-WNW), however, it is 3-4mph stronger here and so is an option if it is
  too light on the Long Mynd normal take off.

  * **Notification:** If pilots want to use the Black Knoll, parking at the bottom and walking up to take off, the farmer requires prior notification. This is to be done via Leavesley Aviation, who can be contacted on 07774856056

  * **Take-off: t**here are two options marked on the map with blue arrows. Both are straightforward but keep watch for traffic coming from the right. Also be aware of pilots under instruction by the school.

  * **Landing:** pilots should top land where posible, but again be aware of those under instruction. Landing is also possible on the step half way down the hill, marked on the map with a green triangle.

  * **There is NO bottom landing field.**

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

**The farmer requires prior notification of pilots intending to park and fly at Black Knoll. This is being coordinated by Leavesley Aviation, who can be contacted on 07774856056.** This is not required for pilots flying from the Club End of the Long Mynd, who may be forced to transition via Black Knoll, top landing and taking off again.

**This site is used by one of our registered schools, for instruction.** Please respect their needs.\
Pilots where possible should try to avoid flying close to students or low over school takeoffs and provide a very wide berth at all times to students displaying a trailing red streamer. Be aware some pre-CP pilots under instruction may not even have a red streamer !!

**The Club does no have any arrangements for bottom landing in front of the hill.**

**Shooting:** During the period from 1st September to 1st February, there is shooting on the hill and woodland below take-off. There are notices put up along the road below take-off warning of the dates and times. **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES** should you fly during the shooting.

**2025/2026 Shooting Dates:**\
**November:   Sat 15th,  Fri 21st,    Sat 29th**\
**December:   Sat 6th,    Sat 20th,   Mon 29th**\
**January:       Fri 2nd,    Sat 10th,   Sat 31st**

**GYMKHANAS** also take place in fields below the take–offs, so be aware and do not over fly these events.

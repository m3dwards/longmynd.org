      This is a LMSC members only site. This site is used by our registered
      schools for

      training.

      A bridleway runs along the top – always check it is clear before launching
      or landing. Remember horses and dogs may take fright even just from ground
      handling!
  - sensitivity: >
      There is a farm with horses below the hill – please do not fly over this
      low and be on the lookout and avoid horses being ridden in the area!
  - sensitivity: Shooting – usually from October to end January shooting may take
      place on and below the hill during which there must be no flying on Black
      Knoll – do not take off from nor fly to it. Shooting dates will be pasted
      above and to the forum when known!
accessAndParking: There are two approaches. The first is from the Long Mynd
  itself – walk along the ridge to the south. This path skirts the Midland
  Gliding Club to the south, and is a long – but flat – walk. Alternatively walk
  up from the road at the bottom of Black Knoll, having parked in the small
  quarry. **DO NOT DRIVE UP THE TRACK.** Park right at the back close up to the
  hill, allowing the farmer to turn right from his track onto the road. Blocking
  this right turn will cause him a huge amount of trouble, so car sharing is
  essential.

  * This site is at the extreme south end of the Mynd, and should be considered
  as an adjunct to the main Long Mynd site. Wind direction is the same
  (WSW-WNW), however, it is 3-4mph stronger here and so is an option if it is
  too light on the Long Mynd normal take off.

  * **Take-off: t**here are two options marked **A** and **B**. Both are straightforward but keep watch for traffic coming from the right. Also be aware of pilots under instruction by the two schools.

  * **Top landing:** the best option is at **B**. But again be aware of those under instruction.

  * **Bottom landing:** this has now changed, and is the lighter field shown in the image below. Though this looks like two fields, it is, in fact, one, with some trees in the centre.

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

This site is used by our registered schools, for instruction. Please respect their needs.\
Pilots where possible should try to avoid flying close to students or low over school takeoffs and provide a very wide berth at all times to students displaying a trailing red streamer. Be aware some pre-CP pilots under instruction may not even have a red streamer !!

**June 2022 – Bottom landing field note** – this may now have cattle in it. While we have not been asked to stop using it, land there at your own risk and only if there is a clear safety margin between your landing area and any cattle. If cattle have been in it, paraglider wings are very likely to get covered in plenty of brown smelly stuff! Its probably best to top or slope land early and avoid the field unless you can determine its state!

During the period from 1st September to 1st February, there is shooting on the hill and woodland below take-off. There are notices put up along the road below take-off warning of the dates and times. **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES** should you fly during the shooting.

**GYMKHANAS** also take place in fields below the take–offs, so be aware and do not over fly these events.

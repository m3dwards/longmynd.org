      This site is very popular with the public. Be especially careful not to
      put anyone at

      risk e.g. with poor launches, being blown backwards or top landings (do not attempt

      if there is not ample clear room). Walkers dogs are frequently not on leads, try to

      ensure none can get caught in your lines. If it is busy wait till it is clear to launch –

      politely ask people to move if necessary.
  - sensitivity: We may not leave vehicles at the top, however a single 4×4 may
      ferry equipment/pilots up and then be returned to the halfway house – see
      notes below.

      Give the mast a good clearance – it has some very expensive equipment
      attached!

  - sensitivity: Fields below may have livestock – please land so as to avoid where
      possible!
accessAndParking: M54 junction 7, turn South. At 0.8 miles, close to a ‘T’
  junction, the access track climbs off to the right. Parking is in the Wrekin
  Forest Glen or Ercall car parks or the (now much reduced) roadside parking.
  The Forest Glen car park will soon require payment by card or online (due May
  2022). Traffic wardens regularly ticket those parking over the double yellow
  lines. It is ok to take a 4×4 vehicle up to the entrance to the TV mast,  drop
  your kit off, and return the vehicle  to the Halfway House and park the said
  vehicle  on the left hand side of the gate (looking up the Wrekin) – do not
  leave a vehicle anywhere on top of the hill, the Halfway House is the ONLY
  place where we have permission to leave a single vehicle on the hill.

  * T/O altitude 1335 ft AMSL

  * Top to bottom SE 580 ft (NW more at 830ft)

  * Take-off: you have to be very careful where you try to launch from. It is possible to launch from the very top by the trig point, but not advisable in most conditions due to the rocks in front. Often better to go west about 150 metres just before the next set of huge rocks with a small bowl depression in the ground before them, with enough room to layout maybe 2 or 3 wings at most; here you’ll be further away from where walkers congregate too. No launch spot is easy – ensure you assess well, are capable and prepare thoroughly. Be careful the wind on launch is true of the real direction.

  * Top landing: not advisable. If your chosen landing area is busy then rather keep soaring or bottom land – its not acceptable to yell to people to move out of your way in preparing to top land nor to land close to members of the public.

  * Bottom landing: PG fields immediately below – do not land in taller mowing grass. If unsure, check with the farmer before flying. PG/HG field near tar road – watch for power lines and trees.

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

#### SPECTATORS AND THE PUBLIC

The Wrekin is a popular walking spot for the public and can be busy, please respect this and launch and fly sensibly. Take care not to be dragged back into the path of spectators and do not attempt to top land if people are in the way.

It is recommended your first visit, at least, is with someone suitably experienced in flying the site in different conditions. Also look at the accessible bottom landing field by the road before heading up to launch and the bottom landing fields immediately below launch you can view from launch itself.

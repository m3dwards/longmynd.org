sensitivities:
  - sensitivity: There is now only 1 ‘PG only’ bottom landing field which is the
      field immediately below the PG launch area – this can be used for
      ‘unplanned’ bottom landings only, no deliberate top to bottoms! Please see
      full important details further below!
  - sensitivity: Black Knoll at the south end of the ridge – usually from October to
      end January shooting may take place on and below the hill during which
      there must be no flying on Black Knoll – do not take off from nor fly to
      it. Shooting dates will be posted to the Black Knoll site guide and to the
      forum when known!
  - sensitivity: Do not overfly farms and horse paddocks/arena’s when low including
      the one just below launch! Plan your landing to avoid this and have a Plan
      B!
  - sensitivity: When low on the ridge, take care when members of the public are
      present including horse riders and dog walkers.
accessAndParking: >-
  From Church Stretton take the Burway and follow signs for the Midland Gliding
  Club. Park diagonally by the fence. Do not obstruct the gateway. Go through
  the gate to the rigging area. DO NOT CLIMB OVER THE FENCE, not least because
  then you miss any notices posted by the gate (as well as giving the impression
  you are trying to avoid paying the day fee, if you are a visitor).


  #### PARKING


  On busy days this is a significant issue, with complaints about the inability for any rescue vehicles to get past. Please makes sure that you park diagonally in such a way that the car does not stick out into the main tarmac roadway at all.  Try to park in such a way as to allow as many vehicles to squeeze in as possible. If you park along the gliding club fence, make sure that you are completely off the tarmac road.

  #### LAUNCHES AND LANDING AREAS


  **Spectators are NOT allowed on the field. However, friends and family are allowed, but are the responsibility of the pilot who must brief them accordingly, particularly with respect to keeping the landing areas clear. Ordinary tourists, with no links to the club, should be asked politely to leave the field. It is the responsibility of all pilots to police this, not just the committee!**


  Skywings Article Feb 2021 by Steve Young – Definitive guide to top landing on the Long Mynd\

  **Take-offs and top landing**


  [](http://www.longmynd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mynd2.jpg "Click to expand")HG rigging is immediately inside the gate – tie-downs are available. T/O is straight ahead and landing is on the northern half of the site.


  Take-off is straightforward but keep a very careful watch for soaring traffic which can be heavy. PG pilots should keep to the right (north) of the white line (marked with painted slabs) to take off and when below the ridge to avoid conflict with HG overshoots. PGs should not slope land in the HG launch area. If they are forced to, they should promptly move to the PG area. A launching hang glider may not see a PG further down the slope.


  Top landing is good except for wind gradient which can occur in the north east corner. This should not be a problem if you are aware of it and approach with sufficient air speed. In strong winds, do not go back beyond the boundary fence. Do not fly behind the road when top landing. This is especially important for hang gliders who believe that they can penetrate back into wind once behind the road; this may not be the case. The road runs diagonally behind our launch field, and it is natural to assume that approaching into wind is as easy from by the entrance gate as the far corner, but this is not always true.  Landing on the road, cars or fence is really not a good idea, and we don’t want to have experienced pilots zooming in low over the cars and giving the false impression to less experienced pilots that this is anything except a very highly skilled and potentially risky manoeuvre.


  **Clear the landing area immediately – this applies to both paragliders and hang gliders**


  We have laid down more flagstones at the Mynd, running roughly N-S, and joining on to the current ones which go to the front of the Mynd. So the area between this new line of stones and the fence is the area which must be cleared immediately after landing, and not used to de-rig, pack away, or for picnics (this is the area marked as ‘HG and PG landing area’ on the diagram above). We simply want to keep an area clear permanently for landings – this is particularly useful for hang gliders, who need more space to land in than PGs, and who are mostly not as precise at spot landing. But it’s also useful for PGs, especially newer pilots, who might not yet be able to land on the spot.


  We are, of course, NOT saying this is the only area you can land. PGs in particular have more landing options, including the front of the hill, and slope landing (not a practical option for HGs). We are simply saying that this designated area should always be kept clear for gliders landing.


  In terms of packing away PGs, do it in front of the new line of stones – there should be plenty of room – or carry the PG over near the gate, and pack away there, next to the HG rigging area, making sure you aren’t in the way of rigged hang gliders or the tie downs that they use.


  **Slope Landing**


  Slope landing is possible below the launch field however PG’s should look out for launching hang gliders and never kite their wing back up immediately below the hang glider launch area. Try not to slope land elsewhere on the Mynd where possible and be especially cautious of the model aircraft bowl and the power lines running up to the gliding club.


  **Bottom Landing**


  Pilots new to the site MUST TAKE LOCAL ADVICE each time on bottom landing before flying since this is a VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE and field availability changes with the seasons and usage, etc. See notes on horses below.


  When alternative fields are in use, notice will be posted at the gate and on the web site.


  HANG GLIDERS – there is a field (with a very slight slope), the panhandle field, over the road and slightly right of T/O, with an overshoot field beyond and slightly left. Do not overfly the horses on the approach to this. There is also a field for emergency use only to the left of launch. See the diagram at the top for details of this.


  PARAGLIDERS – The Long Mynd bottom landing field PG 1 is now under ownership of the National Trust. This is now the only paraglider specific landing field. This is the field immediately below the PG launch area with the single large tree in its centre. Hang gliders should not use PG 1!


  1. The field must only be used for Unplanned landings.\
     Pilots are requested to avoid planned top to bottom flights and to side land if unable to top land.
  2. The field has been out of bounds to us during the months of May, June & July during the first year. Subject to our using the field minimally and considerately, the new agreement may allow  ‘unplanned’ bottom landings all year round. This will be confirmed in due course.\
     The NT purchased the field specifically to create a meadow to grow different varieties of flora to harvest & export the seedlings to other baron land they own, and also to attract varying species of fauna. The meadow will be cut annually as part of its management but especially when the meadow is growing/grown, it is vital that we do not damage it when landing and walking through the field.
  3. Any agreement will be reviewed on an annual basis subject to our compliance of these conditions. However if we fail to abide by the rules it can be cancelled immediately leaving us with no PG bottom landing, so please respect these rules!\
     The field is now included on the NT warden’s patrol schedule and they are likely to be active in the area on flying days to monitor our usage of the btm field and to observe the extent of our impact to the flora & fauna.
  4. **Try to land in the topmost part of the field, immediately pick up your wing causing as little damage to any meadow as possible and exit the field walking along a boundary fence and through the top (only) gate.**\
     **Do not linger in the field and never pack up your wing in the field – immediately in front of the gate is OK. The less we are seen, with no meadow damage and few  footprints, the less restrictive any future agreement is likely to be.**\
     **Always close the gate behind you – if its open, close it anyway.**

#### SITE FEES

***Please note:* if you are not an LMSC member, there is a £3 per day site fee for flying the Mynd.** Please put the money in the collection post by the gate, or [pay online](/pay-fee). Site fees are used to maintain the site (which is not cheap) and when possible (or appropriate), for donations to air ambulance.

* This is an extremely popular site in a Westerly, and can get extremely busy. If you have not flown the site before, take a few minutes to read the all the information on these pages.
* Additional information will often be posted in the notice boards at the entrance.
* T/O altitude 1400 ft AMSL, hill is 700ft above the valley floor.
* No paramotors allowed.
* No dogs allowed.
* Please note that the only area where our two local schools teach ab-initio and early post CP pilots is Black Knoll at the south end of the Mynd.  Please bear that in mind when flying the whole ridge and give those pilots plenty of space and don’t hog their launch area if you can see people preparing to launch.  They have more than enough to concern themselves with than avoiding or being intimidated by other traffic.
* The site is very popular with both hang gliders & paragliders. Please note the field layout below for respective launch and landing details and be aware of the different behavior of the aircraft when mixing. For everyone’s safety, please read the following:  [DHV Flying Together Hang gliders and paragliders](/img/hg-pg-flying-together.pdf)
* Please remember this is an airfield, not a play nor picnic site. Please keep it clear of anything that could be a risk or at risk – including no picnics, no BBQ’s, no kites, no drones, no camping chairs, no prams/pushchairs etc.

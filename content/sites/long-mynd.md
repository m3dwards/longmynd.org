  There is now only 1 ‘PG only’ bottom landing field which is the field
  immediately below the PG launch area – this can be used for ‘unplanned’ bottom
  landings only, no deliberate top to bottoms! Please see full important details
  further below!


  Black Knoll at the south end of the ridge – usually from October to end January shooting may take place on and below the hill during which there must be no flying on Black Knoll – do not take off from nor fly to it. Shooting dates will be posted to the Black Knoll site guide and to the forum when known!


  Do not overfly farms and horse paddocks/arena’s when low including the one just below launch! Plan your landing to avoid this and have a Plan B!


  When low on the ridge, take care when members of the public are present including horse riders and dog walkers.

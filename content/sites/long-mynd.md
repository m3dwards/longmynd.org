sensitivities:
  - sensitivity: There is now only 1 ‘PG only’ bottom landing field which is the
      field immediately below the PG launch area – this can be used for
      ‘unplanned’ bottom landings only, no deliberate top to bottoms! Please see
      full important details further below!
  - sensitivity: Black Knoll at the south end of the ridge – usually from October to
      end January shooting may take place on and below the hill during which
      there must be no flying on Black Knoll – do not take off from nor fly to
      it. Shooting dates will be posted to the Black Knoll site guide and to the
      forum when known!
  - sensitivity: Do not overfly farms and horse paddocks/arena’s when low including
      the one just below launch! Plan your landing to avoid this and have a Plan
      B!
  - sensitivity: When low on the ridge, take care when members of the public are
      present including horse riders and dog walkers.

#### SITE FEES

***Please note:* if you are not an LMSC member, there is a £3 per day site fee for flying the Mynd.** Please put the money in the collection post by the gate, or [pay online](/pay-fee). Site fees are used to maintain the site (which is not cheap) and when possible (or appropriate), for donations to air ambulance.

#### INTRODUCTION

* This is an extremely popular site in a Westerly, and can get extremely busy. If you have not flown the site before, take a few minutes to read the all the information on these pages.
* Additional information will often be posted in the notice boards at the entrance.
* T/O altitude 1400 ft AMSL, hill is 700ft above the valley floor.
* No paramotors allowed.
* No dogs allowed.
* Please note that the only area where our two local schools teach ab-initio and early post CP pilots is Black Knoll at the south end of the Mynd.  Please bear that in mind when flying the whole ridge and give those pilots plenty of space and don’t hog their launch area if you can see people preparing to launch.  They have more than enough to concern themselves with than avoiding or being intimidated by other traffic.
* The site is very popular with both hang gliders & paragliders. Please note the field layout below for respective launch and landing details and be aware of the different behavior of the aircraft when mixing. For everyone’s safety, please read the following:  [DHV Flying Together Hang gliders and paragliders](/img/hg-pg-flying-together.pdf)
* Please remember this is an airfield, not a play nor picnic site. Please keep it clear of anything that could be a risk or at risk – including no picnics, no BBQ’s, no kites, no drones, no camping chairs, no prams/pushchairs etc.

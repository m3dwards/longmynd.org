## **FLYING RULES**

### **GENERAL**

**All pilots must be current BHPA members (see helmet badge) or be able to present on demand an equivalent insurance (in English).** 

**No commercial flying** other than **agreed** CP+ training/tandem flights.

**No acro** in front of the take off areas.

**No Paramotors** on this site

**No** flying/landing close to: horses and riders, or livestock.

**No** overflying farms and horse paddocks/areas when low.

Essential that **ALL** pilots keep clear of HGs on overshoot.

### **RIGGING AREAS**

**Check the site maps.** PGs to the north, HGs to the south. 

HGs use the 11 tie-down loops where possible.

### **TAKING OFF**

This is a westerly site.

T/O altitude is **1420ft/432m AMSL**, hill is 700ft/213m above valley floor.

**BEWARE rabbit holes** and uneven surfaces.

After take off, clear the front of the launch area. 

### **FLYING THE RIDGE**

The ridge is 4 miles/6.5km long so there is plenty of room after clearing the launch area. Please note the following:

**Midland Gliding Club**

Do **NOT** overfly launch area less than **1500ft/460m ATO**.

Do **NOT** cross in front of the windsock below ridge height when towing is active. If you hit strong lift you could rise up in front of a tug or powered glider.

Be aware of glider landing circuits – see diagram.

**Black Knoll** (southernmost part of the Mynd)

Used for PG training. 

October to January – beware, can be used for shooting. Check Telegram for notices on shooting dates, when flying is **NOT** permitted

**Model flying bowl** (1 mile north)

Used occasionally for model flying.

Beware, some are **big**. Clear it by at least **1000ft/300m ATO** above it.

### **LANDING AREAS - Check the map.**

Pilots new to the site must seek advice before flying. Field availability may change with the seasons.

### **Top Landing Approaches**

There is plenty of room to top land at the site, but after landing **ALL** pilots must clear the landing area immediately(PG & HG)

![](/img/lm-approaches.jpeg)

### **Side Landings**

**PGs** – if slope landing, move promptly to the PG take off area. 

You won’t be able to see a HG on overshoot behind the brow of the hill. 

Do **NOT** kite back up the slope below the HG launch area

Beware rabbit holes, rocks and trees.

### **Bottom Landings - Check the map.**

**PG1** bottom landing field is owned by the National Trust and **should not be used from May to July** except for 'unplanned/emergency landings' only. No deliberate top to bottom flights allowed to this field.\
**Land in the topmost part of the field.** Note field slopes away from the hill.  **\    Carry to the top gate to pack. \
Always close the gate behind you** – if it’s open, close it anyway.

**PG2** bottom landing field can be used all year. This field can be identified by the large green shed in the NE corner. **Ensure you have enough height to cross the road. Avoid all horses on approach.**

**HG1** can be use for PG landings if there are no HGs landing there

**HG1** (pan handle) and **HG2** bottom landing fields can be used all year, take care with livestock. 

### **CONTROLLED AIRSPACE**

Birmingham CTA at 30mls/48km, Halfpenny Green at 24mls/39km, RAF Cosford at 23mls/37km.

### **AIR HORNS**

**What are they for?** Use it when we need to clear the air and ground quickly.

**What to do if you hear one?** Either immediately choose a safe landing at the top of the hill, or fly away from the LMSC launch and stay away until safe.

sensitivities:
  - sensitivity: There is now only 1 ‘PG only’ bottom landing field which is the
      field immediately below the PG launch area – this can be used for
      ‘unplanned’ bottom landings only, no deliberate top to bottoms! Please see
      full important details further below!
  - sensitivity: Black Knoll at the south end of the ridge – usually from October to
      end January shooting may take place on and below the hill during which
      there must be no flying on Black Knoll – do not take off from nor fly to
      it. Shooting dates will be posted to the Black Knoll site guide and to the
      forum when known!
  - sensitivity: Do not overfly farms and horse paddocks/arena’s when low including
      the one just below launch! Plan your landing to avoid this and have a Plan
      B!
  - sensitivity: When low on the ridge, take care when members of the public are
      present including horse riders and dog walkers.

  ## Parking


  Parking can be found in the small layby near the main gate. Please park sensibly and do not block either the main gate or the gate to the side field. Doing so will jeopardise our right tofly. The farmer needs access to the land at all times. Please do not park in the lane or cause any obstruction to passing traffic. In the summer drier months it is possible to park just inside the gate on the grass. Do not under any circumstances drive your vehicle to take off or let any sheep or cattle out!

  ## The Site


  Long Mountain is a gentle NNW facing shallow slope site and needs a good 15mph plus wind to stay up. The site works well in stronger winds so a good strong launch technique as recommended. As a general rule, if Llangollen is blown out then this site usually works, a forecast of 10mph+ is what you are looking for.


  The most important factor about this site is there is NO official botttom leading options. You must either slope or top land at all times. There are no formal agreements with any land owners to use the fields below take off.


  Should you find yourself in an emergency situation and need to bottom laid then try to choose a field without crops or animals in please? If approached by the land owner please be as courteous as possible, make your excuses and leave. There are no obvious gates or paths at the bottom of the site so getting back up top is going to be very difficult indeed.


  **If you are unsure whether you can stay up or slope land, please do not launch.**


  The site is also perfect for ground handling as there is plenty of space to practice in.


  ## Take Off


  You can reach take off by accessing the main field via the main gate(s). Walk straight forward up a slight incline where you will reach the top of the slope some 400 yards or so. Carry up is not difficult. The ideal wind direction is a NNW and will take a little bit of NW and up to N. It is NOT recommended you fly this site when the wind is coming directly from the W, NE or E direction. The site is also a perfect thermal site in the right conditions. Big height gains and long distances have been done from this site.


  ## Top and Slope Landing.


  Long Mountain has a large slope and top landing area. Landing is reasonably easy even for low airtime pilots. This is an ideal site to practice your slope landings. When it gets strong you can drift back a long way and land quite safely.


  A word of warning, there does seem to be a sink hole close to the gates where the cars are parked. If landing here please be careful.


  There are two natural gulleys, just below take off which help channel the wind and thermals up the face. Depending where you launch from it is not easy to see these gulley's before you are airborne. This is where the 'house' lift can usually be found. It is also a good idea to use the tops of the gulley's as a reference point to decide to slope land if the lift, has dropped. If you fly lower than the tops of the gulley there is a very good chance you will run out of landing options. The walk back up from this point is not an easy one so be warned. It is best to get on the slope before this happens.

  ## XC Potential


  There is great XC potential from Long Mountain. 100K plus attainable. Corndon Hill and the Long Mynd are possibilities to aim for. Out in front are Moel Golfre and Rodney's Pillar. Another challenge is to gain enough height to fly to Rodney's and back. Height gains of as high as 4000' ato have been made. Bear in mind that just down the road is Welshpool Airfield where light aircraft and helicopters fly from. Please be very observant at all times. 


  ## Site Fees Payable


  As this site is fully private we need to pay for the privilege of flying there. There is a day fee of £5 per pilot payable online using this link **XXXXXX.** Cash is not accepted.


  **The fee is payable by everyone, including LMSC members.**


  Our permission to continue to use this site rests on the land owner receiving payments from every pilot that flies.

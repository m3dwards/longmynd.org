  - sensitivity: This site is currently very sensitive in a number of respects
      including parking, bottom landing, noise and Covid spread worries! Please
      follow the site rules and common sense and be especially careful not to
      upset anyone. If you hear continuous dog barking while flying, try (if
      safe) to move to a different part of the hill. Any issues please pack up
      and leave immediately and submit a report to your committee – it is
      critical to remain polite, try to ease any tension and if possible ask for
      contact details so the LMSC committee can investigate. Any confrontation
      with locals could be very detrimental.

      This is a site for a small number of pilots to go and fly quietly! Ideal
      for XC!


      UPDATED RULES (March 2022)  :

      DO NOT PARK IN THE VILLAGE – TRY TO AVOID THE VILLAGE ALTOGETHER.

      TRY TO TOP / SLOPE LAND WHEN POSSIBLE (when safe to do so) THUS AVOIDING THE OFFICIAL BOTTOM LANDING NEXT TO THE VILLAGE (an alternative field away from the village is being investigated).

      PARKING REMAINS AN ISSUE – TRY TO CAR SHARE AND ENSURE YOU DO NOT BLOCK LANES NOR ACCESS TO GATES.

      DO NOT FLY LOW OVER ANYTHING OTHER THAN OPEN LAND – AVOID HOUSES AND FARMS AND ANIMALS AND PEOPLE!

      KEEP NOISE TO A MINIMUM – NO SHOUTING BETWEEN PILOTS / KEEP RADIOS TURNED DOWN LOW!

  - sensitivity: This site is currently very sensitive in a number of respects
      including parking, bottom landing, noise and Covid spread worries! Please
      follow the site rules and common sense and be especially careful not to
      upset anyone. If you hear continuous dog barking while flying, try (if
      safe) to move to a different part of the hill. Any issues please pack up
      and leave immediately and submit a report to your committee – it is
      critical to remain polite, try to ease any tension and if possible ask for
      contact details so the LMSC committee can investigate. Any confrontation
      with locals could be very detrimental.

      This is a site for a small number of pilots to go and fly quietly! Ideal
      for XC!


      UPDATED RULES (March 2022)  :

      DO NOT PARK IN THE VILLAGE – TRY TO AVOID THE VILLAGE ALTOGETHER.

      TRY TO TOP / SLOPE LAND WHEN POSSIBLE (when safe to do so) THUS AVOIDING THE OFFICIAL BOTTOM LANDING NEXT TO THE VILLAGE (an alternative field away from the village is being investigated).

      PARKING REMAINS AN ISSUE – TRY TO CAR SHARE AND ENSURE YOU DO NOT BLOCK LANES NOR ACCESS TO GATES.

      DO NOT FLY LOW OVER ANYTHING OTHER THAN OPEN LAND – AVOID HOUSES AND FARMS AND ANIMALS AND PEOPLE!

      KEEP NOISE TO A MINIMUM – NO SHOUTING BETWEEN PILOTS / KEEP RADIOS TURNED DOWN LOW!

accessAndParking: >-
  B4368 west from Craven Arms. Turn left after Aston on Clun to Clunbury.
  Limited parking space in a small quarry at the bottom, or in field marked.
  From the quarry, follow the track up and around the west of the hill. At the
  gate at the end of the track, turn left to the top of the hill. Shut the gate.
  This track is unsuitable for cars, and doubtful for 4WD. If using 4WD, then at
  the gate across the track, turn left and park in the field.


  Parking is an issue – try to car share and please park sensibly – DO NOT PARK IN THE VILLAGE itself as this has caused serious friction in the past and could jeopardize our use of the site.
flying: >-
  * T/O altitude 875 ft AMSL

  * Top to bottom 400 ft

  * Take-off and top landing are straightforward.

  * Bottom landing is in the flat field marked, but check the position off the power lines as these can make the landing difficult. These are indicated in red on the Google image above. Also check whether the fields are in crop, and do not land if this is the case – you will have to top/slope land. Note these fields are downwind of trees so expect wind shear and turbulence, therefore on a strong thermic day or if the wind is strong they may not be suitable.

  * No paramotors allowed.

  * No dogs allowed.

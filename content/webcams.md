      **LMSC Webcam: pointing north to the LMSC launch site.**


      Currently 20 minutes updated and also video turned on. (See here for previous images*: <https://www.mysolarcam.com/LongMyndNorth/>)*


      Replacement camera lens, it's image quality is back to how it was when new with the addition of a UV filter which might prevent solar damage in the future.

      **Current day Video clips looking North**


      Click on the time you want to watch – but beware if you are sneaking a view from work – it plays music whether you like it or not.

      **LMSC Webcam: pointing south.**


      Temporarily removed for maintenance.  Data provider changed, new larger solar panel being tested and awaiting replacement waterproof enclosure (this image is provided looking through cellotape window in an icecream box!), so not the final version.


      Camera replaced 26th March 2025, now set to 20 minutes intervals and also video turned on. (See here for previous images*: <https://www.mysolarcam.com/LongMyndSouth/>)*

      **Time lapse webcams**\

      We now have two time lapse cams (courtesy of the MGC). If the images are static on your mobile device, or not updating, or to see it slightly bigger, use these links instead: [west cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/piwebcam/westcam.html) and  [hangar cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/hangarcam/hangarcam.html).


      **West cam**: this shows the sky state over the last 40 minutes, updated every minute.

      **Hangar cam**: this is the view from the hangar looking east towards the usual MGC launch point, over the last hour. The images are updated each minute from just before/after sunrise/sunset.

      **Adstone:**  This is a weather station on the ridge north of Wentnor, not ours though.

    description: Now active and live for weather data, however the camera stopped
      connecting to the main unit at the start of December 2024,  Holfuy
      believed it to be likely as a permanent failure with no spare parts
      available.  However after a big storm with 100mph winds it's started
      working again, albeit intermittently.

      Camera is pointing out along the ridge in a northern direction from the
      very top of the highest peak, installed on the weather vane pole which
      comprises of a Raven which is the landowner’s family emblem.

      Clatter is currently open to LMSC members only (temporary guest membership
      can be obtained by contacting any committee member).


      Data collected constantly but averaged over 15 minutes, camera every twenty minutes. Wind strengths etc. will be pretty accurate in a SW wind, other directions pretty good as the station is higher up the hill than the launch and with an open aspect in all directions.  Being located on top of a hill in Mid Wales it is expected that the skystate and weather information will be of some use relating to our other sites in the area. Finally, it’s installed on site at Clatter, with the camera looking west across towards launch.

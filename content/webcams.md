      **Time lapse webcams**\

      We now have two time lapse cams (courtesy of the MGC). If the images are static on your mobile device, or not updating, or to see it slightly bigger, use these links instead: [west cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/piwebcam/westcam.html) and  [hangar cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/hangarcam/hangarcam.html).


      **West cam**: this shows the sky state over the last 40 minutes, updated every minute.

      **Hangar cam**: this is the view from the hangar looking east towards the usual MGC launch point, over the last hour. The images are updated each minute from just before/after sunrise/sunset.

    description: Now active and live – however due to the poor O2 signal the unit is
      intermittently unreliable – it’s been fine for years when it was situated
      at Sarn.  Sadly the device only runs on a 2G network, which makes it
      difficult to move to any other data supplier in this location.

      **LMSC Webcam: pointing north to the LMSC launch site.  This a live stream
      video, pointing at our club owned launch field, with an option to view
      past video too from multiple days.  Due to constraints by the
      hardware/software manufacturers it will only be available on iphone and
      android phones, for current club members.  Access details sent out by
      email from webcollect to club members.**

      **Time lapse webcams**\

      We now have two time lapse cams (courtesy of the MGC). If the images are static on your mobile device, or not updating, or to see it slightly bigger, use these links instead: [west cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/piwebcam/westcam.html) and  [hangar cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/hangarcam/hangarcam.html).


      **West cam**: this shows the sky state over the last 40 minutes, updated every minute.

      **Hangar cam**: this is the view from the hangar looking east towards the usual MGC launch point, over the last hour. The images are updated each minute from just before/after sunrise/sunset.

      **Adstone:**  This is a weather station on the ridge north of Wentnor, not ours though.

    description: Possibly may require replacement camera lens in the future, in a
      similar manner to that already carried out at Clatter, but this one is
      massively more difficult to access.

      Camera is pointing out along the ridge in a northern direction from the
      very top of the highest peak, installed on the weather vane pole which
      comprises of a Raven which is the landowner’s family emblem.

  - name: Clatter
    description: >-
      Clatter is currently open to LMSC members only (temporary guest membership
      can be obtained by contacting any committee member).


      Data collected constantly but averaged over 15 minutes, camera every twenty minutes. Wind strengths etc. will be pretty accurate in a SW wind, other directions pretty good as the station is higher up the hill than the launch and with an open aspect in all directions.  Being located on top of a hill in Mid Wales it is expected that the skystate and weather information will be of some use relating to our other sites in the area. Finally, it’s installed on site at Clatter, with the camera looking west across towards launch.  Camera Lens replaced in 2025.

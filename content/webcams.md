      **MGC Webcam: Pointing west to the windsock at the MGC (updated every minute).**


      **Please note that as of 25th June 2023, the MGC supplied images are back online for us and them, but they still don't have their weather station working so the west camera image does not show it yet.**

      **Time lapse webcams**\

      We now have two time lapse cams (courtesy of the MGC). If the images are static on your mobile device, or not updating, or to see it slightly bigger, use these links instead: [west cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/piwebcam/westcam.html) and  [hangar cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/hangarcam/hangarcam.html).


      **West cam**: this shows the sky state over the last 40 minutes, updated every minute.

      **Hangar cam**: this is the view from the hangar looking east towards the usual MGC launch point, over the last hour. The images are updated each minute from just before/after sunrise/sunset.

  - name: The Lawley
    description: Now active and live – however due to the poor O2 signal the unit is
      intermittently unreliable – it’s been fine for years when it was situated
      at Sarn.  Sadly the device only runs on a 2G network, which makes it
      difficult to move to any other data supplier in this location.

      Most recent camera image below (updated every 10 minutes) it is pointing
      out along the ridge in a northern direction from the very top of the
      highest peak, installed on the weather vane pole which comprises of a
      Raven which is the landowner’s family emblem.


      Camera turned off temporarily to see if the weather station works more reliably
  - name: Clatter
    description: >-
      Clatter is currently open to LMSC members only (temporary guest membership
      can be obtained by contacting any committee member).


      Data collected constantly but averaged over 15 minutes, camera every twenty minutes. Wind strengths etc. will be pretty accurate in a SW wind, other directions pretty good as the station is higher up the hill than the launch and with an open aspect in all directions.  Being located on top of a hill in Mid Wales it is expected that the skystate and weather information will be of some use relating to our other sites in the area. Finally, it’s installed on site at Clatter, with the camera looking west across towards launch.

  - name: Carbon Community nr Llandovery
    description: This Photo has kindly been authorised by carboncommunity.org for us
      to show.  It’s of use to mid Wales pilots and also  to show the
      progression of weather fronts.  It is located down near the Heart of Wales
      railway line by the Cynghordy viaduct which is north east of
      Llandovery.  The carbon community is a scientific reasearch led group
      aiming to identify the most efficient means of retaining carbon for the
      benefot of the environment, a good opportunity for anyone interested to
      volunteer and get out in the countryside when not flying. Their idealogy
      is “A new reforestation approach, rooted in science, to increase carbon
      sequestration in trees & soil.”

      The camera points approximately towards a South direction.

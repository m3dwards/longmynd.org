      **LMSC Webcam: pointing north to the LMSC launch site.**


      Updated at 10 minute intervals. (See here for previous images*: <https://www.mysolarcam.com/LongMyndNorth/>)*


      Replacement camera lens, it's image quality is back to how it was when new with the addition of a UV filter which might prevent solar damage in the future.

      **MGC Webcam: Pointing west to the windsock at the MGC (updated every minute).**


      **Please note that as of 25th June 2023, the MGC supplied images are back online (most of the time) for us and them, but they still don't have their weather station working so the west camera image does not show it yet.  Please view with caution and check the date and time on their images where shown.**

      **Time lapse webcams**\

      We now have two time lapse cams (courtesy of the MGC). If the images are static on your mobile device, or not updating, or to see it slightly bigger, use these links instead: [west cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/piwebcam/westcam.html) and  [hangar cam](https://www.midlandgliding.club/piwebcam/hangarcam/hangarcam.html).


      **West cam**: this shows the sky state over the last 40 minutes, updated every minute.

      **Hangar cam**: this is the view from the hangar looking east towards the usual MGC launch point, over the last hour. The images are updated each minute from just before/after sunrise/sunset.

    description: Now active and live for weather data, however the camera stopped
      connecting to the main unit at the start of December 2024,  Holfuy
      believed it to be likely as a permanent failure with no spare parts
      available.  However after a big storm with 100mph winds it's started
      working again, albeit intermittently.

      Camera not currently available but if it was - it is pointing out along
      the ridge in a northern direction from the very top of the highest peak,
      installed on the weather vane pole which comprises of a Raven which is the
      landowner’s family emblem.

  - name: Clatter
    description: >-
      Clatter is currently open to LMSC members only (temporary guest membership
      can be obtained by contacting any committee member).


      Data collected constantly but averaged over 15 minutes, camera every twenty minutes. Wind strengths etc. will be pretty accurate in a SW wind, other directions pretty good as the station is higher up the hill than the launch and with an open aspect in all directions.  Being located on top of a hill in Mid Wales it is expected that the skystate and weather information will be of some use relating to our other sites in the area. Finally, it’s installed on site at Clatter, with the camera looking west across towards launch.


      The camera has been affected by UV light, an attempt is planned to replace the lens, but no direct replacements are available as it's so old, a potential fix has been procured but it may be a struggle to get it to work.

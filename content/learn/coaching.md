      its all down to Crawford

      There is a common misconception that only high achieving pilots with 100s
      or 1000s of hours airtime are capable of coaching low airtime pilots. Not
      only does the practise of coaching require the coach to devote time to
      helping other less experienced pilots, but there are several interpersonal
      and flying skills required of a coach that are not obvious. These include
      the ability to assess a pilot’s skill level without even having met
      him/her before; to establish a successful rapport with the new pilot
      without coming on too strongly; to be able to ask open questions and
      encourage the pilot to talk about their past experience, current level,
      expectations, their assessment of the conditions of the day, and their
      possible flight plan; and very importantly to LISTEN. Without these
      communication skills how else is a coach to determine what is going on in
      the pilot’s mind, and possible behaviour in the air? This is key to
      helping a coach to understand what stage the pilot is at, and what the
      next step might be, even if it’s a top to bottom to confirm that he/she
      can do what is he claims to be able to do. It is then a matter of checking
      pilot preparedness, rigging, pre-take off checks, ensuring there is not
      traffic in the area, before critically observing the flight and landing,
      noting any issues to be followed up, and then importantly taking the time
      to debrief the pilot after the flight and resolving any observed points.


      So the coach also needs to assess the conditions on behalf of the new pilot, identify whether this is a confirmation flight of previously claimed achievements or if the next task should be attempted, and ensuring that virtually all the flight plan comes from the pilot. More advanced coaching covers theory both on the hill and in the classroom (requiring effective presentation skills), and together with coaching ridge soaring in traffic and XC techniques, all benefit from the principles used for basic coaching. These assessment and communication skills are not readily found in daily life or everyday pilots on the hill, or necessarily in those who have consistently high competition records or 1000s of hours. Neither are they naturally acquired. But they are essential to ensuring the safety of our new pilots coming into our club or the sport, or indeed any sport.


      This is why the BHPA run a coaching scheme, why we as BHPA coaches are able to help people in their introduction to club flying safely, and why we are insured to the tune of £2million in the event of any unfortunate incident that may be attributed to a coach in a court decision. It means that the unfortunate pilot and family will receive adequate compensation, and that the acting coach in the last resort is not going to lose his/her house, family, car, etc, or the club to lose its assets!


      No coaching scheme is going to be successful without a level of trust between the new pilot and the coach, between coaches themselves, and between the club and the club coaching system. Our successful LMSC coaching scheme runs against the background of substantial achievements by our club coaches, both for theory and exams, but very importantly in the less publicised practical coaching on the hill.

### For pilots needing coaching

The Long Mynd soaring club has a large number of club coaches, who will be happy to offer experienced advice and help to newly qualified hang-glider and paraglider pilots, enabling them to safely bridge the gap from school to club. For more experienced visiting pilots, they can also provide site briefings to help you make the most of unfamiliar flying sites. The club is currently working towards a more focussed coaching approach, which will enable anyone who wants help and advice to direct their request at those coaches who are most experienced and with the right availability to be able to work to to everyones best advantage.

Please note the up to date list of accredited LMSC coaches is on the [coaching page](http://www.longmynd.org/?page_id=54 "LMSC coaches").

Coaching done by an LMSC coach under the BHPA coaching scheme is always free. Some coaches also offer additional commercial services, such as guiding.

### Why be a coach?

If you feel you would like to put something back into the sport, to help others through situations you may have found yourself in, or if you find yourself helping others but are unsure of what you should be saying or doing, then become a coach. Helping somebody off the hill can create a daunting feeling of responsibility and the coaching course will give you the confidence to do this safely. Attending a course will also help with your own flying and your understanding of the sport.

### How to become a club coach

You don’t have to be an experienced or skilled pilot to be a good coach. Often the most effective coaches are those who have just gone through the early flying experiences that are still fresh in the mind. So after flying for several months and with about 20 hours or more airtime, lack of experience need not be a barrier to becoming a coach. Approach one of the existing coaches, and talk through what is involved. Course dates and venues are listed in Skywings.

### What do you learn on the coaching course?

The principles of free flying coaching and mentoring are common with many sports and also within work environments. Topics include skills assessment, personal abilities, appropriateness of sites and met conditions, identifying next steps, task planning, and take off, flying and landing skills. The course is largely classroom based, but is practical and allows for interaction between all our flying disciplines.

### Becoming an LMSC club coach

Once you have been on the course, you will become a member of the LMSC coaching team, and will find out about how we go about coaching in the club. The main coaching concerns center around newly qualified pilots who are suddenly faced with a busy site, lots of new and unknown faces, and a list of several tasks and skills to develop. The function of the coach is to help these pilots through an challenging few months, and to reach a good level of club flying competence quickly and safely.

Existing club (and senior) coaches are encouraged to redo the course at least once every five years to remain current as a club coach.

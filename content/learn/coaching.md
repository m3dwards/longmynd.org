      T﻿he following are the people you should contact to get some coaching at
      the LMSC


      Coaching done by an LMSC coach under the BHPA coaching scheme is always free. Some coaches also offer additional commercial services, such as guiding. **This page is for guidance only. When you contact a coach listed below, it is important to confirm that they are current (paid up) BHPA members and that they are registered as a coach with the BHPA.**


      Coaches may be contacted directly below, or there is a club Telegram group for CP pilots to interact directly with LMSC club coaches – **Telegram Group: LMSC Coaching Group** (for pilots looking for coaching and site advice, must be minimum BHPA CP rated). To join the group, either ask someone to add you or email club \[at] longmynd.org asking to join.

      There is a common misconception that only high achieving pilots with 100s
      or 1000s of hours airtime are capable of coaching low airtime pilots. Not
      only does the practise of coaching require the coach to devote time to
      helping other less experienced pilots, but there are several interpersonal
      and flying skills required of a coach that are not obvious. These include
      the ability to assess a pilot’s skill level without even having met
      him/her before; to establish a successful rapport with the new pilot
      without coming on too strongly; to be able to ask open questions and
      encourage the pilot to talk about their past experience, current level,
      expectations, their assessment of the conditions of the day, and their
      possible flight plan; and very importantly to LISTEN. Without these
      communication skills how else is a coach to determine what is going on in
      the pilot’s mind, and possible behaviour in the air? This is key to
      helping a coach to understand what stage the pilot is at, and what the
      next step might be, even if it’s a top to bottom to confirm that he/she
      can do what is he claims to be able to do. It is then a matter of checking
      pilot preparedness, rigging, pre-take off checks, ensuring there is not
      traffic in the area, before critically observing the flight and landing,
      noting any issues to be followed up, and then importantly taking the time
      to debrief the pilot after the flight and resolving any observed points.


      So the coach also needs to assess the conditions on behalf of the new pilot, identify whether this is a confirmation flight of previously claimed achievements or if the next task should be attempted, and ensuring that virtually all the flight plan comes from the pilot. More advanced coaching covers theory both on the hill and in the classroom (requiring effective presentation skills), and together with coaching ridge soaring in traffic and XC techniques, all benefit from the principles used for basic coaching. These assessment and communication skills are not readily found in daily life or everyday pilots on the hill, or necessarily in those who have consistently high competition records or 1000s of hours. Neither are they naturally acquired. But they are essential to ensuring the safety of our new pilots coming into our club or the sport, or indeed any sport.


      This is why the BHPA run a coaching scheme, why we as BHPA coaches are able to help people in their introduction to club flying safely, and why we are insured to the tune of £2million in the event of any unfortunate incident that may be attributed to a coach in a court decision. It means that the unfortunate pilot and family will receive adequate compensation, and that the acting coach in the last resort is not going to lose his/her house, family, car, etc, or the club to lose its assets!


      No coaching scheme is going to be successful without a level of trust between the new pilot and the coach, between coaches themselves, and between the club and the club coaching system. Our successful LMSC coaching scheme runs against the background of substantial achievements by our club coaches, both for theory and exams, but very importantly in the less publicised practical coaching on the hill.
    title: What is coaching about
  - title: Be a club coach
    description: >-
      \

      We always need new club coaches. You can do as much or as little as you want. If you’re interested in being a club coach, please contact coaching \[at] longmynd.org for further details.
  - title: Why be a coach
    description: If you feel you would like to put something back into the sport, to
      help others through situations you may have found yourself in, or if you
      find yourself helping others but are unsure of what you should be saying
      or doing, then become a coach. Helping somebody off the hill can create a
      daunting feeling of responsibility and the coaching course will give you
      the confidence to do this safely. Attending a course will also help with
      your own flying and your understanding of the sport.
  - title: How to become a club coach
    description: You don’t have to be an experienced or skilled pilot to be a good
      coach. Often the most effective coaches are those who have just gone
      through the early flying experiences that are still fresh in the mind. So
      after flying for several months and with about 20 hours or more airtime,
      lack of experience need not be a barrier to becoming a coach. Approach one
      of the existing coaches, and talk through what is involved. Course dates
      and venues are listed in Skywings.
  - title: What do you learn on the coaching course
    description: The principles of free flying coaching and mentoring are common
      with many sports and also within work environments. Topics include skills
      assessment, personal abilities, appropriateness of sites and met
      conditions, identifying next steps, task planning, and take off, flying
      and landing skills. The course is largely classroom based, but is
      practical and allows for interaction between all our flying disciplines.
  - title: Becoming an LMSC club coach
    description: >-
      Once you have been on the course, you will become a member of the LMSC
      coaching team, and will find out about how we go about coaching in the
      club. The main coaching concerns center around newly qualified pilots who
      are suddenly faced with a busy site, lots of new and unknown faces, and a
      list of several tasks and skills to develop. The function of the coach is
      to help these pilots through an challenging few months, and to reach a
      good level of club flying competence quickly and safely.


      Existing club (and senior) coaches are encouraged to redo the course at least once every five years to remain current as a club coach.

      [Go to podcast page](http://www.judithmole.net/blog/?page_id=123)


      ### Pilot and AP Exam – reading list


      * BHPA Pilot Manual – BHPA Mark Dale – Covers almost all that is needed to get through

      * UK Air Map 500,000 – 2007/8 – CAA – Essential, need to know all the aspects and meanings

      * Understanding Flying Weather – Derek Piggott – The ‘bible’

      * Meteorology and Flight, Pilot’s guide to weather – Tom Bradbury – Another bible

      * The Air Pilots Manual 1 Flying Training – Trevor Thom – Useful in parts for principles of flight

      * The Air Pilots Manual 2 Aviation law and Met -Trevor Thom – Good & readable on air law but get an up-to-date one, Met OK too

      * The Air Pilots Manual 4 The Aeroplane, technical – Trevor Thom – Interesting background reading

      * Flying Conditions – Dennis Pagen – Pretty good theory and practical base – probably difficult to obtain now

      * The Microlight Flying Manual – R D Campbell & J Jones – Good for Air Law, Navigation, Met, Principles of Flight – probably difficult to obtain now

      * Hang Gliding Techniques Dennis Pagen – For a deeper understanding of HG flight theory & practise, cheap too

      * Understanding the Sky – Dennis Pagen – good Meteorology book.


      ### Pilot and Advanced Pilot exams


      For information about the Pilot and AP exams, please email coaching@longmynd.org. Theory topics include Meteorology, Navigation, Flight theory & Instruments, air law, etc.
  - title: Preparing for your first XC
    description: >-
      Going cross country for the first time can be very intimidating, and many
      pilots never bother going XC, preferring to stay on the ridge and develop
      their skills there – which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, of
      course, and there is no obligation to go XC.


      However, going XC can be very rewarding, and challenging, and does mean you need to perfect your skills like thermalling, landing out, etc. However, before you go XC, there are certain other things you need to do:


      * **Buy** **some** **airmaps** and learn how to read them. There is a lot of restricted airspace around our sites, and it is essential that pilots intending to go XC do not infringe that airspace. Landing in the middle of an RAF airfield is not a good idea!.

      * It is definitely worth **buying** **a** **GPS** **with** **MapSource**, i.e. a GPS on which you can load the airspace, so that you know exactly when you are approaching somewhere you should not be! This does not replace buying and understanding airmaps, but it does make navigation when you are flying a lot easier.

      * **Get** **your** **Pilot** **P** **qualification**. This involves study and an exam, covering airlaw, meteorology and principles of flight.  It’s very important to get this because, without it, you have no third party insurance when you go XC. Hopefully you will never need this – but each year, there are claims on it, and imagine the cost if, for example, you take out a power line (as has happened). Once you are ready to take the exam, contact [coaching](mailto:coaching@longmynd.org) and we will arrange a time and place for you to do it. You can also download a [list of tasks for the pilot rating](https://www.bhpa.co.uk/documents/members/index.php?doc=Pilot_Tasks.pdf) and the [Pilot exam syllabus](https://www.bhpa.co.uk/documents/members/index.php?doc=Pilot_Syllabus.pdf).


      **Other** **sources** **of** **information** **are**


      * [wessexhgpg.org.uk](http://wessexhgpg.org.uk/Coaching/pilot_test.html) – a good test with an on-line multiple choice exam, courtesy of the Wessex club


      ### Helping you go XC


      From time to time, club members will run XC courses and guiding on our sites. There are also various other sources of information:


      * Some podcasts on going XC can be found on [Judith and Geoff’s podcast pages](http://www.judithmole.net/blog/?page_id=123)

      * Those pages also include some [XC tips](http://www.judithmole.net/blog/?page_id=99)

      * XC training syllabus. This has been produced by Roy Dade, and was written by him to help him progress to flying XC – so new XC pilots please note, it’s not a qualification, it’s a series of guidelines and resources, which you might find useful. [Download it here](/img/cross-country-syllabus-version-5.pdf).

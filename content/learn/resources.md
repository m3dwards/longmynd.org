### CANP

Many of our sites are in areas used for training by low flying military aircraft. Submitting a CANP on time will alert military aircrew and additionally generate a NOTAM for civil aircraft and will thus identify where Hang Glider/Paraglider activity is likely to be occurring for the day – keeping you and others safe. It’s easier than ever to submit using this excellent website with club sites already listed (try it first with the ‘try sending a test’ option) or use the freephone NOTAM service on **0800 515544!**\
<https://canp.logans.me.uk/>\
Details on what it is and how it works are here: <https://canp.logans.me.uk/about.html>

**Introduction.** This policy has been designed as an extension to your Club’s code of conduct which is based on treating other members with respect. 

**Rules of the Game.** Before you consider posting a message on social media please do the following:

* **Use common sense**: Use your best judgment at all times. If you’re uncertain if something is inappropriate or questionable then don’t post it.
* **Mind your manners**: Be respectful, kind and civil. You should not tolerate discrimination or hateful comments about anyone including your rivals.
* **Be human**: Use your own voice; speak in a warm, approachable tone and most importantly, be yourself. Anything posted on the behalf of your club is permanent and a reaction of the club and its members.
* **Respect copyrights and fair use**: Always give people proper credit for their work, and make sure you have the right to use something before you publish, for example – match photographs taken by someone else.
* **Be aware of confidentiality**: Only reference information that is publically available. Do not disclose any information that is confidential without prior consent. For example a personal telephone number of a coach.
* **Security**: Social media accounts should be created using an official club email address, which a designated individual should have responsibility for. Passwords should be protected and any suspicions of account hacking should be raised with the social media platform immediately.
* **You don’t want to put people off**. Social media is an excellent tool for promoting your club’s activities and engaging with your members, so you should openly encourage social media use for club-related purposes. This could include people asking about who else is coming along to training or when the next game is taking place.
* **Misconduct**. Failure to adhere to this policy may result in members being blocked from official groups. In the first instance offending messages will be deleted, the individual posting it will be reported by admins to the LMSC Committee who, depending on the transgression may revoke the offenders membership. In extreme cases where the law has been potentially broken the Club may contact the Police.

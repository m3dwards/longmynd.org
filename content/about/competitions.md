W﻿e not only host competitions but we also have quite fun local comps for progressing pilots

or any competition queries, please email [comps@longmynd.org](mailto:comps@longmynd.org). The form to book a competition is at the bottom of this page. PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY, as it lays out the various rules we have for competitions wishing to be based here.

### **LMSC members entering National or International competitions**

The club has many members with experience of competitive flying at the highest level; if you are thinking about entering your first competition in the UK, or abroad, or have some experience of competition flying and want to improve we can find a pilot to help you, so get in touch at [comps@longmynd.org](mailto:comps@longmynd.org) and he will point you in the right direction.

### Externally organised competitions

The Long Mynd also hosts externally organised competitions, such as the British Paragliding Cup, the Hang Gliding Open, etc. In order to maintain the sites, and avoid the danger of over-crowding the club now has a number of terms and conditions for competitions. These include, but are not limited to:

* £100 charge for use of the Mynd sites, payable to the club in advance of the competition (payable by cheque or online: see below).
* No bank holiday weekends are available for competitions.
* Parking can now be a problem and a shuttle bus may be a good solution. Never block gate entrances or lanes or local amenity parking. Never drive to the top of Corndon hill!
* Ideally we ask for a months notice to host a competition on our sites. A competition hosted with us giving the full notice period, is most likely to be able to have access to all our competition friendly sites.
* With sufficient notice, competitions hosted elsewhere may request to visit to use one of our sites but ‘hosted’ competitions always take priority.
* Whether ‘hosted’ or ‘visiting’, an absolute minimum of 24 hours notice is required to request to use a *particular site* to give us time to clear with landowners and to advise our members; the more notice given, the more likely you will have access.
* No dogs allowed on take off/landing fields.
* Always shut gates behind you even if they are open when you arrive.
* Nothing is agreed until you have received a reply confirming, so if you do not receive a reply please get in touch again in good time!
* Full requirements and conditions are to be found in our Competitions Booking Form, please ensure you read this before making an enquiry.

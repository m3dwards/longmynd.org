W﻿e not only host competitions but we also have quite fun local comps for progressing pilots

For any competition queries, please email [comps@longmynd.org](mailto:comps@longmynd.org). The form to book a competition is at the bottom of this page. PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY, as it lays out the various rules we have for competitions wishing to be based here.

### **LMSC members entering National or International competitions**

The club has many members with experience of competitive flying at the highest level; if you are thinking about entering your first competition in the UK, or abroad, or have some experience of competition flying and want to improve, we can probably find a pilot to help you. So get in touch at [comps@longmynd.org](mailto:comps@longmynd.org) and we will point you in the right direction.

### Externally organised competitions

The Long Mynd also hosts externally organised competitions, such as the British Paragliding Cup, the Hang Gliding Open, etc. In order to maintain the sites, and avoid the danger of over-crowding the club now has a number of terms and conditions for competitions. These include, but are not limited to:

* All participating pilots must be members of the LMSC to ensure that all insurances are active. At the Long Mynd they may pay the launch fee by using the on-site collection box. Pilots may also take advantage of the short term membership options. In certain circumstances, such as when teh comp has paid a group comp fee to the club, the event organiser may negotiate temporary free membership for all (named) participants.
* There may be a fee payable to the club in advance of a competition. This is because the Long Mynd Club is charged by some landowners for use of many of it's best sites. 
* No bank holiday weekends are available for competitions.
* Parking can be a problem and a shuttle bus may be a good solution. Never block gate entrances or lanes or local amenity parking. Never drive to the top of Corndon hill!
* Ideally we ask for a months' notice to host a competition on our sites. A competition hosted with us, giving the full notice period, is most likely to be able to have access to all our competition friendly sites.
* With sufficient notice, competitions hosted elsewhere may request to visit to use one of our sites but ‘hosted’ competitions always take priority.
* Whether ‘hosted’ or ‘visiting’, an absolute minimum of 24 hours notice is required to request to use a *particular site* to give us time to clear with landowners and to advise our members; the more notice given, the more likely you will have access.
* No dogs are allowed on any take off or landing fields.
* Always shut gates behind you. Sometimes even if they are open when you arrive! Please respect the activities of the livestock farmers in the area as much as you can.
* Nothing is agreed until you have received a reply confirming, so if you do not receive a reply please get in touch again in good time!
* Further requirements and conditions are to be found in our Competitions Booking Form, please ensure you read this before making an enquiry.

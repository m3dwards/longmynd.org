      **Concerning all Neoprene Speed wing brake handles**


      A structural failure of a Neoprene Speed wing brake handle has been reported. After further investigation we have found that it is possible for the overall strength of the handle to be insufficient, especially after ageing.


      You should no longer fly with these handles. Before the next flight you **must** replace the Neoprene handles with the standard webbing version. Please contact your Ozone dealer to arrange replacements.

      **Concerning all Neoprene Speed wing brake handles**


      A structural failure of a Neoprene Speed wing brake handle has been reported. After further investigation we have found that it is possible for the overall strength of the handle to be insufficient, especially after ageing.


      You should no longer fly with these handles. Before the next flight you **must** replace the Neoprene handles with the standard webbing version. Please contact your Ozone dealer to arrange replacements.

  - description: Skywings E-news Update AustrialAlpin buckle warning A safety
      warning has been released regarding the AustrialAlpin Cobra harness buckle
      that is widely used on hang glider, paraglider and paramotor harness types
      from many different manufacturers. Some buckles have been identified in
      which the the rivets have not been closed; the release clips may detach
      with potentially very serious consequences. All pilots should examine the
      buckles on their harnesses at the first opportunity. If these are of the
      of the AustrialAlpin Cobra type please download the safety notice issued
      by AustriAlpin for further
      information. [](http://downloads.austrialpin.at/Safety_notice_2016_EN.pdf)

  - title: Reserve parachute repacking
    description: >-
      General advice is to repack parachutes far more frequently than most
      people do.  6 Months seems to be a general rule of good practice.  The
      reasons for this are because modern synthetic materials tend to build a
      'memory', so when you deploy it will take longer to come away from the
      folds and be slower to open.  This can also be caused by a static build
      up.  When a reserve is in it's inner container, it is compressed, and that
      can only get worse as time goes by, even if you don't sit on it whilst
      waiting on the hill, which is a very big NO for doing that
      anyway.  Moisture build up needs to be released and the best way to do
      that which is advised by all manufacturers is to open and leave indoors in
      dry conditions for a day or so before repacking.


      Maybe next time you do a repack at home or go to a club repack, you should test deploy your reserve beforehand and then leave it to air at home  - then put it loose in a spare rucksack or bin bag to carry it to the repacking session along with your harness.

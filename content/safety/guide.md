      This is especially important advice for new or low airtime pilots.
      Launching can be a very high mental workload, so many things to
      concentrate on, yet one of the most important is look-out. Trainees learn
      in an intrinsically safe supported environment where the instructor will
      ensure that a mid-air collision is not going to happen the moment you
      attempt to take off. For Paraglider pilots, please make it a very definite
      and physical action to be facing out from the hill immediately prior to
      reverse launching, check that no one is flying, about to launch or
      especially might be about to slope land in front of you. Then quickly
      carry out the reverse launch to get the wing in the air and then check
      again before moving forward to get into the air. If another pilot is
      flying, they may not see you preparing to launch, they may be in a
      situation where they are unable to take avoiding action. Even a near miss
      can have a catastrophic outcome if one or other attempts an emergency turn
      and either loses control of the wing or hits the ground at speed.


      This physical action of looking has to be just like when you are taking a car driving test and checking the rear view mirror, look and make it obvious by moving your head to show that you are looking

      The club has instigated a club specific register of incidents. This is
      independent of the official BHPA incident reporting scheme and not so
      laborious. If you see anything at all which relates to a potential safety
      hazard, or an actual incident, whether you are the pilot concerned or not,
      please can you email [safety@longmynd.org](mailto:safety@longmynd.org). No
      personal details will be recorded (to avoid data protection issues and for
      anonymity sake), and the full text of the log will not be published.


      The value of this will be fully appreciated if it ever prevents just one other person from getting hurt through lack of knowledge. It will also reduce any potential legal threat to the club by showing that we are taking a pro-active stance on pilot safety.


      If anything becomes apparent that a safety notice needs to warn pilots, then this will provide a rapid way of collating information and a route to getting LMSC pilots and if necessary all BHPA pilots warned through Skywings.

  - title: BHPA Incident Reporting online form
    description: >-
      The form is available on the BHPA website and has to be submitted online
      rather than the old UK paper method. If you ever need one to report
      anything – and it’s not just for accidents, but anything that may help
      other pilots by knowing about something that you have seen with your
      equipment, discovered or witnessed.

      This is especially important advice for new or low airtime pilots.
      Launching can be a very high mental workload, so many things to
      concentrate on, yet one of the most important is look-out. Trainees learn
      in an intrinsically safe supported environment where the instructor will
      ensure that a mid-air collision is not going to happen the moment you
      attempt to take off. For Paraglider pilots, please make it a very definite
      and physical action to be facing out from the hill immediately prior to
      reverse launching, check that no one is flying, about to launch or
      especially might be about to slope land in front of you. Then quickly
      carry out the reverse launch to get the wing in the air and then check
      again before moving forward to get into the air. If another pilot is
      flying, they may not see you preparing to launch, they may be in a
      situation where they are unable to take avoiding action. Even a near miss
      can have a catastrophic outcome if one or other attempts an emergency turn
      and either loses control of the wing or hits the ground at speed.


      This physical action of looking has to be just like when you are taking a car driving test and checking the rear view mirror, look and make it obvious by moving your head to show that you are looking

  - title: Paragliders – pre-flight including checking for twisted risers is critical
    description: >-
      Below is an extract from the Analysis section of a fatal accident
      investigation report published by the AAIB (Air Accident Investigation
      Branch)


      The pilot arrived at the Eyam Edge site and then launched, in a relatively short period of time, with a twisted right riser. A twist in the right riser would have had the effect of increasing friction on the brake control line and making the canopy more difficult to control. It is possible that, shortly after getting airborne, the pilot became aware of this twist but was unable to correct it in flight. Having subsequently suffered an asymmetric canopy collapse and ‘Cravat’, leading to a descending spiral to the left, he would have needed to apply the right brake to recover. Friction burn marks on the twisted riser indicated that the pilot was using a great deal of force with the right brake but, demonstrably, he had insufficient height to affect a recovery.


      If a pilot experiences a canopy collapse which provokes a high rate of descent, at heights of 300 feet or less, then the guidance from both the BHPA and the DHV is to use the emergency parachute immediately.

    description: >-
      With thanks to the DHV, a useful article on active flying of paragliders,
      contains some useful guidance on practicing on the ground. Especially
      useful to low airtime pilots or those used to only flying when conditions
      are smooth and easy:

  - title: BHPA advice and news on Glider certification
    description: >-
      **EN paraglider classes and pilot skills** The BHPA table relating EN/LTF
      glider certification classes to the appropriate pilot skill levels
      required to fly them safely is now available for ready access on this
      website. The table builds on the EN certification scheme‘s own description
      of the sort of pilot level required for each certification class, and adds
      a rough guide to the level of experience and currency levels that are
      appropriate. The table was produced to draw pilots‘ attention to the
      degree of flying experience, and the amount of regular flying, required to
      be able to fly any paraglider safely within their limitations. This is of
      particular use to those pilots who may be tempted to trade up to a higher
      level of certification for their next glider. It might surprise some to
      realise that the appropriate skill/experience set for an EN C wing, for
      example, includes being very current, being familiar with active flying
      and SIV techniques, and understanding the consequences of flying a glider
      with limited passive safety. Pilots should note however that certification
      classes are becoming increasingly wide, and also that the new breed of EN
      D gliders have almost nothing in common with earlier EN D types. If you
      are in any doubt at all about the suitability of any glider, consult an
      instructor or a highly-experienced coach. Read and download the entire

      BHPA news about Testing and certification of the new EN D wings
    description: As previously reported, testing of EN D gliders was briefly
      suspended in November following an accident involving Alain Zoller at Air
      Turquoise/Para Test while testing a candidate EN D glider. The opinion put
      forward by Air Turquoise and the SHV was that the current crop of EN D
      gliders was becoming too dangerous to test. After consideration at the
      Paraglider Manufacturers Association (PMA) meeting on December 9th it was
      agreed that the testing of EN D gliders would recommence, citing that the
      testing house‘s role was to test gliders, not to decide which gliders may
      or not be tested. However a testing house may still refuse to test a
      glider if the manufacturer‘s own test flight videos or live demo flights
      are not satisfactory. One of the big issues arising was the very tight
      tolerances in the EN schedule for the 75% collapse test for these wings.
      This will be addressed in the new EN regime for 2012, which will be
      updated to make it closer to the wider tolerances in folding angle and
      collapse percentages permitted in the LTF (DHV) tests. A second issue was
      the use of folding lines. These are additional lines which are not part of
      the canopy as it is sold, but are connected to extra tabs to allow the
      test pilot to induce an exact 75% collapse at the leading edge that does
      not exceed 50% at the trailing edge, as specified by the tighter EN
      tolerances. An interim consensus has been reached that collapse lines will
      not be used at all in the testing of EN A and B gliders, and only used on
      C and D gliders if tests at the testing house first show that the correct
      collapse can‘t be obtained without them. If fitted they must have the same
      layout as the A lines. Given the wider tolerances currently specified by
      LTF for collapse folding, and the imminent changes to the EN standard, it
      is believed in some quarters that the need for collapse lines will be much
      reduced. Where they are used, the tabs will now be fitted to production
      canopies so that collapse lines can be reinstated for the purposes of
      pilots undergoing SIV training. The changes in 2012 will harmonise EN and
      LTF tests, making the testing to both that most manufacturers do much
      easier. The PMA is trying to find out whether it is possible to switch
      over to the new EN test regime ahead of schedule. The advantage of all
      this for former Open Class competition pilots is that they will be getting
      gliders with greater passive safety and only minor limitations (lower top
      speed). The downside is that Serial Class pilots will have to realise that
      the new competition-oriented EN D gliders will be a world apart from the
      old, familiar EN D class.
  - title: Hang Glider area on the Mynd
    description: >-
      It is a mandatory requirement purely on safety grounds that Paragliders do
      no launch or attempt to do so to the left of the white marked slabs
      running down the field approximately 1/3 of the way across the field. If
      any paraglider slope lands in this area – especially low down, then they
      must bundle their wing up and walk across to the north to the normal
      Paraglider launch area. Please remember that there may not have been any
      hang gliders around when you launched, but they could be just out of your
      sight if you are low, and waiting for the right ‘safe’ moment when no
      paragliders are passing their launch or landing path. The comments below
      are from a Hang Glider pilot and should give a balanced perspective as to
      why this is so important.


      “My main concern is for overshooting HG pilots. It has been increasingly the case that PG pilots who slope land in front of the HG take off and overshoot area, either wait where they land and take off again from there or inflate their canopy and walk it back to the PG take off area. When the conditions are marginal (hence the slope landing), it is much more likely that a HG pilot will overshoot his top landing and a canopy that pops up in front of him leaves him no where to go -> fatal accident (it has happened elsewhere). These PG pilots have no view of the top of the field, so have no idea if a hang glider is about to come over when they inflate. Other issues I have are that PG pilots have the habit of turning left after take off and staying in front of the HG take off area (and overshoot area), rather than simply transiting through. This either means that the HG pilot does not aviate at all, or takes off anyway and causes the PG pilot to take sudden avoiding action. Talking to many low time HG pilots, I know that they frequently don’t fly when it is like this for fear of collision on take off or if they overshoot their top landing. As an experienced pilot, I am happy to take my chance but still dislike the potential conflict. The ridge is 4 miles long after all, why not use it? Finally, although not so much of a safety issue, the packing up of PG wings in the middle of the LZ creates a much bigger obstacle for a HG pilot landing than a PG. This is true, not only the less experienced, but for any pilot that suffers rough air on approach.”
  - title: Photography in the air
    description: How often have you watched videos from a paraglider pilot flying,
      with one or maybe both hands off the brakes, sometimes only a few hundred
      feet above the ground. There are many many cases throughout the world
      where serious accidents have happened because the pilot does not have both
      hands on the brakes. If you have a collapse at this point (which is much
      more likely because the pilot cannot be flying the wing actively but is
      merely a passenger at that point). How much height do you need to deploy
      your reserve safely, because that may be the only chance you have?. Please
      think, do you really need to take those pictures/video, and if so why
      don’t you blag a tandem flight, there are lots of tandem pilots around now
      and most of them are short of people who want to have a go, so just ask
      around. It’s much more fun with two pilots flying tandem anyway.
  - title: Boring keep yourself alive stuff
    description: >-
      All this is simple learn from others mistakes and not your own!


      * Check your equipment before you launch, don’t assume that your reserve will stay in it’s pouch like it did yesterday – having them come out on take-off or just afterwards is very very dangerous as has been proven time and time again.

      * Double check your pre-flight drill. If someone comes over to talk to you, start again, check your helmet strap, check that you are clipped into the harness properly, check that the lines/wing are ok, check that your instruments are attached properly, check the sky for aircraft and look at the immediate weather coming in. It only takes a few seconds to do that and it stops you looking a plonker.

      * Make sure that you have self briefed yourself, if not briefed by coach etc – where will you land if the wind increases/decreases becomes turbulent. Is the selected location ok and not in crop/cows etc. What is your plan immediately after take-off – left or right turn and why

      * Don’t change more than one thing at a time, different wing, harness, helmet, site, weather conditions. The more new things the greater the mental workload and the lower the ability to cope with unforseen conditions. This goes for Comp’ pilots just as much as new CP’s.
  - title: Paraglider pilot ground handling injuries
    description: Please be aware that grabbing hold of paraglider lines when air is
      in the wing will be like grabbing a hot knife – they will cut straight
      through skin and bone. You will not be able to control the wing if it’s
      dragging you through holding the lines – any pressure you put into them
      will have very little effect except to increase the tension on those lines
      and make them cut you better. The risers are far more effective and much
      less painfull. It’s hard to think if you are getting dragged, or about to,
      but do try to think about how best to stop the wing. Also gloves may
      provide at least some protection.

In addition to checking [Notices to Airmen](https://www.bhpa.co.uk/documents/safety/canp/notam.php) (NOTAMs) for restrictions and warnings, you should submit a CANP to warn other pilots of your intentions. This is particularly important if flying Monday - Friday.

The procedure is primarily designed to warn military low flying aircraft of our activity, but in 2014 the system was expanded, and CANPs are now published as NOTAMs. This allows civilian as well as military pilots to see where we are likely to be, although our ceiling will always be limited to 2,000' AGL.

CANP bookings are now handled by Low Flying Coordination (LFC) at the Military Airspace Management Cell.

The procedure itself is very simple. You should aim to submit your notification to Low Flying Coordination (LFC) by 8.00pm Monday - Thursday and 3.00pm on Friday. This lead-in time is essential to get your notification published in time. You probably won't know exactly where you are going the day before so it is permissible to nominate 2-3 sites at the same time. Notifications made after this time may still be accepted, but there is no guarantee that they will reach other pilots in time.

All notifications now generate a WARNING of 2nm radius. Other pilots may still decide to fly through the NOTAM but they should be aware of your activity.

You can request a NOTAM via CANP (Civil Aircraft Notification Procedure) online using the [CANP for free fliers app](https://canp.logans.me.uk/), or by phone or e-mail. The latter can be a slow and cumbersome process, whilst the app is simplicity itself. The app has a built in database of flying site names and their respective OS grid references, which makes submitting a CANP request via the app much easier than by phone or email, providing the site you wish to fly is in the app's sites database.

For further information about the CANP for Fliers app and how to add more sites to its database, please visit our [CANP for free fliers app page](https://www.bhpa.co.uk/documents/safety/canp/canp_app.php).

If you prefer to submit a CANP via phone or email, you can contact the LFC by phone on 0800 515544 or 01489 443100, or by email at [Swk-mamclfcoord@mod.gov.uk](mailto:Swk-mamclfcoord@mod.gov.uk). But the LFC preference is an email rather than a phone call.

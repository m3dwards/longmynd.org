  # Welcome to the Long Mynd Soaring Club (LMSC) – supporting pilots since 1975!


  The LMSC has 13 soaring sites located in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and mid-Wales. Most are ‘open’ sites except for Clatter and The Wrekin for which we ask non-members to contact a committee member for a day’s temporary pass before going to the site. 


  Access for al pilots requires BHPA membership.


  The Long Mynd site itself has an honesty box and we ask non-members for a day fee of £3 which goes towards the sites upkeep.

# Welcome to the Long Mynd Soaring Club (LMSC) – supporting pilots since 1975!

The LMSC has 13 soaring sites located in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and mid-Wales. Most are ‘open’ sites except for Clatter and The Wrekin for which we ask non-members to contact a committee member for a day’s temporary pass before going to the site.

The Long Mynd site itself has an honesty box and we ask non-members for a day fee of £3 which goes towards the sites upkeep. The day fee can also be paid online here: https://webcollect.org.uk/lmsc/subscription

If you fly the sites often, please join to support the club and for all the benefits of membership: https://webcollect.org.uk/lmsc/subscription

The general club email address is: club [at] longmynd.org. Further and emergency contacts are on the ‘Contact Us’ page.

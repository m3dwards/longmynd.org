  # Welcome to the Long Mynd Soaring Club (LMSC) – supporting pilots since 1975!


  The LMSC has 13 soaring sites located in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and mid-Wales. Most are ‘open’ sites except for Clatter and The Wrekin for which we ask non-members to contact a committee member for a day’s temporary pass before going to the site.


  The Long Mynd site itself has an honesty box and we ask non-members for a day fee of £3 which goes towards the sites upkeep. The day fee can also be <a href='https://webcollect.org.uk/lmsc/event/day-fee'>Day Fee</a>[](https://webcollect.org.uk/lmsc/subscription)
